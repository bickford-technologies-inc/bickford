# Max-Value Execution Plan for Derek Bickford (Immediate)

## Objective

Create the fastest path to **maximum near-term enterprise value** by turning Bickford into a provable, defensible, and sellable compliance system with auditable outcomes, while standardizing a shared definition of a **sale** that aligns incentives across engineering, product, and commercial efforts.

---

## Definition: What Counts as a Sale

A **sale** is a **binding commercial commitment** in which a buyer (customer or strategic partner) **exchanges value** (cash, contractually obligated credits, or signed procurement authority) for **access to Bickford’s execution authority** (software, API, or system capability) within a defined scope and term.

**Minimum criteria (must meet all):**

1. **Signed agreement** (MSA/SOW/Order Form/License/Procurement authority).
2. **Consideration exchanged** (cash, PO, non‑revocable credit, or contractual obligation).
3. **Defined scope** (product/module/API, usage rights, and duration).
4. **Accountable outcome** (explicit deliverable, SLA, or compliance artifact).

**Not a sale:**

- LOIs, pilot conversations, demos, or “design partner” discussions without consideration.
- Verbal commitments or internal approval without executed documents.
- Non‑binding “trial” usage without a paid or contractually committed term.

## Immediate Execution Architecture (0–30 Days)

### 1. Anchor Offer (Week 1)

**Goal:** Ship a single, clear, high‑value offer that is easy to explain, buy, and validate.

**Core offer:**

- “Bickford Compliance Execution Layer” with:
  - Canon enforcement (hard‑fail on violations)
  - Hash‑chained, tamper‑evident ledger
  - External verification artifact (audit certificate)

**Deliverables:**

- One‑page offer sheet (value proposition, scope, pricing tiers)
- Demo script + live walkthrough
- Compliance certificate example artifact

### 2. Proof of Value (Week 1–2)

**Goal:** Provide measurable proof that Bickford uniquely enables auditability and enforcement.

**Proof assets:**

- Live demo: “Violation attempt → hard fail → ledger log → verification output”
- ROI claim: time/cost saved on compliance audits (quantified assumptions)
- Benchmarks: performance overhead and ledger integrity verification time

### 3. High‑Leverage Targets (Week 2)

**Goal:** Focus outreach where compliance enforcement is mandatory and budgets are real.

**Target clusters:**

- Regulated AI in healthcare, finance, defense
- AI vendors selling into regulated customers
- Security/compliance platforms that need audit trails

**Action:** build a ranked target list with names, role titles, and 1‑page custom pitch.

### 4. Paid Pilot Conversion (Week 2–4)

**Goal:** Convert top 3–5 targets into paid pilots with immediate revenue.

**Pilot structure:**

- 30–60 day paid pilot
- Fixed scope: 1 integration, 1 compliance workflow, 1 certification artifact
- Success criteria: enforcement proof + verification artifact + reliability metrics

### 5. Sales Definition Enforcement (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Align every internal action to the **sale definition**.

**Rules:**

- Any work not directly tied to a signed, paid commitment is “pre‑sale.”
- All pre‑sale effort must map to a conversion step (demo, pilot, contract).
- Engineering priorities are justified by closing or delivering paid pilots.

---

## 30–90 Day Execution Architecture

### 6. Standardize Compliance Artifacts

- Publish canonical audit certificate format
- Provide verifier tooling or instructions for third parties
- Ensure hash‑chain integrity is externally reproducible

### 7. Scale Through Partner Channels

- Target compliance firms, audit agencies, and AI integrators
- Offer white‑label/embedded ledger verification
- Create partner referral incentives tied to signed pilots

### 8. Lock in Switching Costs

- Require ledger continuity to maintain certification status
- Make audit artifacts cumulative across time (compliance history)
- Offer delta‑verification (lighter audit overhead for returning clients)

## Core Metrics (Daily / Weekly)

**Sales Definition Metrics:**

- # of signed commitments (must meet all sale criteria)
- Revenue committed (cash or contractual)
- Time‑to‑sale from first contact

**Execution Metrics:**

- # of successful enforcement events (hard‑fail logs)
- # of verification artifacts issued
- Ledger integrity checks passed

**Leverage Metrics:**

- Conversion rate: demo → paid pilot
- Pilot → contract conversion
- CAC per signed commitment

---

## Immediate Next Actions (This Week)

1. **Finalize the offer sheet** (1 page, clearly priced).
2. **Produce the live compliance demo** (script + recording).
3. **Publish the sale definition** in onboarding and internal docs.
4. **Build the top 20 target list** with decision‑makers.
5. **Convert 2–3 paid pilots** using the defined scope.

---

## Principle to Enforce

**Every action must increase the probability of a signed, paid commitment, or directly deliver one.**

If an activity does not map to the sale definition, it is **not priority**.
