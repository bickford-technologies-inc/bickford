Everything stays on-premise.\n\nWhat's your security model? Need full details before I'll consider.\nDay 5: Technical Deep-Dive Call (45 minutes)\nAttendees: Sam (CIO), Your Security Engineer, You (AE)\n\nSam: \"Walk me through your data flow. Where does our RFP data go?\"\n\nYour Security Engineer:\n\nGreat question. Let me show you our architecture:\n\n1. Data ingestion: Your RFP uploads are encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)\n2. Storage: Encrypted at rest (AES-256) in your dedicated database partition\n3. Processing: Embeddings generated in isolated containers (no data sharing between customers)\n4. Vector DB: Your data is logically separated (tenant isolation)\n5. Access control: Role-based (only your team sees your data)\n\nWe're SOC2 Type II certified. Here's our security whitepaper.\nSam: \"What about OpenAI? You send our data to OpenAI for embeddings?\"\n\nYour Security Engineer:\n\nYes, but with safeguards:\n- We use OpenAI's API with BAA (Business Associate Agreement)\n- OpenAI doesn't train models on customer data (contractually prohibited)\n- We can deploy on-premise if you prefer (no external API calls)\n\nFor classified work, we offer air-gapped deployment:\n- Docker container runs on your infrastructure\n- Embeddings model runs locally (no internet connection)\n- Vector DB on-premise (pgvector on your Postgres)\n- Zero telemetry / phone-home\nSam: \"How much for on-premise?\"\n\nYou: \"One-time setup: $100K. Annual support: $30K. Your data never leaves your network.\"\n\nSam: \"Too expensive. What about FedRAMP?\"\n\nYou:\n\nWe're in the FedRAMP authorization process (JAB P-ATO expected Q2 2026).\n\nFor now, we offer FedRAMP-equivalent controls:\n- Deploy in AWS GovCloud (IL4/IL5)\n- FIPS 140-2 validated encryption\n- Continuous monitoring (ConMon)\n- Annual penetration testing (results shared)\n\nPrice: $15K/month (2× premium over standard SaaS)\nSam: \"Let me review your security docs and get back to you.\"\n\nResult: ✅ Security review scheduled (Day 15)\n\nDay 15: Security Review Meeting (90 minutes)\nAttendees: Sam (CIO), Sam's Security Architect, Your CISO, You\n\nSam's Architect: \"I reviewed your SOC2 report. Few questions...\"\n\nQ1: \"What's your incident response time SLA?\" A: \"Critical incidents: 1 hour acknowledgment, 4 hours resolution. We'll add this to your contract.\"\n\nQ2: \"What happens if there's a breach?\" A: \"We carry $10M cyber insurance. Plus, contractual liability for breach notification within 24 hours.\"\n\nQ3: \"Can we audit your code?\" A: \"For enterprise customers, yes. We provide source code escrow + annual security code review.\"\n\nSam's Architect: \"Impressed. I'll recommend approval.\"\n\nSam: \"Okay. Send me a pilot proposal. 90 days, 5 users, full security features.\"\n\nResult: ✅ Pilot proposal sent (Day 20)\n\nDay 30: Pilot Kickoff\nPilot Terms:\n\nDuration: 90 days\nUsers: 5 proposal writers\nPricing: $5,000 for pilot (applied to annual contract if they convert)\nSuccess criteria:\nZero security incidents\n30%+ time savings validated\nPass internal security audit\nDay 60: Mid-Pilot Check-In\nUsage Stats:\n\n12 OPTR runs completed\n0 security incidents\nAverage time savings: 37.2 hours per proposal (93% reduction)\nUser satisfaction: 4.8/5\nSam: \"Team loves it. Security audit passed. What's the annual price?\"\n\nYou:\n\nBased on your usage:\n- Mid-Market tier: $7,500/month × 12 = $90,000/year\n- Includes: Unlimited runs, 20 user seats, priority support\n- Less $5K pilot credit = $85,000 first year\n\nAdd-ons available:\n- FedRAMP deployment: +$180K/year (+$15K/month)\n- On-premise option: +$130K/year ($100K setup + $30K support)\n\nWhich deployment model do you prefer?\nSam: \"Standard SaaS is fine. We'll add FedRAMP next year when you have the authorization.\"\n\nDay 90: Pilot Complete → Contract Signed\nFinal Terms:\n\nStandard SaaS: $85,000/year (first year with credit)\nYear 2+: $90,000/year\nContract: 3-year commitment\nSLA: 99.9% uptime, 4-hour critical incident response\nSecurity: SOC2 Type II annual audit (reports shared)\nExpansion option: FedRAMP upgrade available when authorized\nSam: \"Approved. Let's get the contract signed.\"\n\nDeal Metrics:\n\nSales cycle: 90 days (discovery → close)\nACV: $85,000 (Year 1), $90,000 (Year 2+)\nCAC: $12,000 (security review + pilot)\nLTV: $270,000 (3-year contract)\nLTV:CAC: 22.5:1\nKey Lesson: Security-conscious customers need deep technical validation. Invest in security docs upfront.\n\nScenario 2: \"Frugal Fran\" — Startup on Tight Budget\nCustomer Profile\nName: Fran Martinez\nTitle: Founder/CEO\nCompany: AgileDefense (startup, 2 years old)\nRevenue: $2M annually\nEmployees: 8 (no dedicated proposal staff)\nPain: Can't afford $800/month (\"That's 10% of our OpEx!\")\nObjection: \"Too expensive for a startup\"\nTimeline: 15 Days (Discovery → Close with Discount)\nDay 1: Inbound Demo Request (Website)\nFran's Form Submission:\n\nCompany: AgileDefense\nRevenue: $2M\nEmployees: 8\nUse case: \"Need to bid on more contracts but don't have time\"\nBudget: $200-500/month\nYour SDR Response (same day):\n\nHi Fran,\n\nThanks for your interest! I see you're looking for proposal acceleration.\n\nQuick clarification: How many proposals do you bid on per year?\n\nOur pricing starts at $800/month, but we have startup programs for \ncompanies under $5M revenue.\n\nAvailable for a 20-minute call tomorrow?\n\nBest,\n[Your SDR]\nFran's Reply:\n\nWe bid on ~6-8 proposals/year. $800/month is 48% of our target profit margin!\n\nCan you do $300/month? I can't justify more.\nDay 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)\nYou: \"Fran, walk me through your proposal process today.\"\n\nFran:\n\nIt's chaos. I'm the CEO but I also write proposals (no budget for writers).\n\nEach RFP takes me 40-50 hours. I bill at $200/hour as a consultant, \nso every proposal costs me $8-10K in opportunity cost.\n\nI turned down 10 opportunities last year because I didn't have time.\nYou: \"Let's do the math together...\"\n\nROI Calculation (live on screen):\n\nYour current state:\n- Proposals: 6/year\n- Time per proposal: 40 hours\n- Opportunity cost: $200/hour\n- Total annual cost: 6 × 40 × $200 = $48,000\n\nWith OPTR:\n- Time per proposal: 5 hours (saving 35 hours)\n- Annual time saved: 6 × 35 = 210 hours\n- Value: 210 × $200 = $42,000\n\nOPTR cost: $800/month × 12 = $9,600\nNet benefit: $42,000 - $9,600 = $32,400\n\nPlus, you can bid on those 10 missed opportunities:\n- Additional proposals: 10\n- Win rate (conservative): 20%\n- Expected wins: 2 contracts\n- Avg contract value: $500K\n- Profit margin: 20%\n- Additional profit: 2 × $500K × 20% = $200,000\n\nTotal benefit: $32,400 + $200,000 = $232,400\nROI: 2,421%\nFran: \"Okay, the math works. But I still can't afford $9,600 upfront. Cash flow is tight.\"\n\nYou: \"What if we structured it differently?\"\n\nDay 3: Creative Deal Structure\nProposal:\n\nStartup Accelerator Program:\n\nYear 1 Pricing (discounted):\n- $300/month × 12 = $3,600/year\n- Conditions:\n  1. You must be <$5M revenue (verified annually)\n  2. You give us a testimonial + case study after 6 months\n  3. Logo on our website as customer\n  4. You graduate to standard pricing ($800/month) at $5M revenue\n\nYear 2+ Pricing:\n- If revenue <$5M: $400/month ($4,800/year)\n- If revenue >$5M: $800/month ($9,600/year)\n\nWhy we offer this:\n- We want startups to grow with OPTR\n- Your success = our success (you'll buy more seats as you scale)\n- Your testimonial helps us sign more startups\nFran: \"This is perfect. Can I start immediately?\"\n\nYou: \"Yes. I'll send the contract today. Welcome to OPTR!\"\n\nDay 5: Contract Signed\nFinal Terms:\n\nYear 1: $3,600 ($300/month)\nIncludes: 10 OPTR runs/month, 3 user seats, email support\nTestimonial due: Month 6\nAuto-upgrade to $800/month when revenue >$5M\nDeal Metrics:\n\nSales cycle: 5 days (fastest!)\nACV: $3,600 (Year 1)\nCAC: $500 (mostly self-service)\nExpected LTV: $50,000 (assumes growth to $5M+ in Year 3)\nLTV:CAC: 100:1\nKey Lesson: Don't lose deals over price. Create tiered programs for budget-conscious customers. Land & expand strategy.\n\nScenario 3: \"Demanding Donna\" — Wants Custom Features\nCustomer Profile\nName: Donna Williams\nTitle: VP of Proposals\nCompany: MegaCorp Defense\nRevenue: $1.2B annually\nEmployees: 2,000 (50 proposal writers)\nPain: \"Your product is 80% of what we need.

But I still can't afford $9,600 upfront.

Reduce 15 weeks to 2 weeks.\"\n\nMike: \"Show me.\"\n\nDay 10: Demo (with Mike + 3 Capture Managers)\nDemo goes well. Capture Managers love it.\n\nMike: \"I'm sold. But I need buy-in from VP of BD, CIO, and CFO.\"\n\nYou: \"Let's map the decision process...\"\n\nStakeholder Map:\n\nChampion: Mike (Director of Capture)\n- Role: Drive internal adoption\n- Concern: Will team actually use it?\n- Need: User testimonials, training plan\n\nEconomic Buyer: VP of BD (Sarah)\n- Role: Approve budget\n- Concern: ROI justification\n- Need: Revenue impact model\n\nTechnical Buyer: CIO (James)\n- Role: Approve technical architecture\n- Concern: Security, integration with existing systems\n- Need: Technical deep-dive, security docs\n\nFinancial Approver: CFO (Lisa)\n- Role: Final sign-off on budget\n- Concern: Total cost of ownership\n- Need: Multi-year cost projection\n\nUsers: 3 Capture Managers\n- Role: Provide input (already on board from demo)\nYou: \"Okay, I'll schedule separate meetings with each stakeholder.

Prove it.\"\n\nYou: \"Here's the data from other defense contractors...\"\n\nROI Model (using Sarah's numbers):\n\nCurrent state:\n- Captures per year: 20\n- Win rate: 15%\n- Avg contract value: $50M\n- Revenue: 20 × 0.15 × $50M = $150M\n\nWith OPTR (10% win rate improvement):\n- Win rate: 25%\n- Revenue: 20 × 0.25 × $50M = $250M\n- Incremental revenue: $100M\n- Profit margin: 15%\n- Incremental profit: $15M\n\nOPTR investment: $300K/year\nROI: $15M / $300K = 50:1\nSarah: \"Impressive. If CIO and CFO approve, I'm in.\"\n\nDay 30: Meeting with CIO (Technical Buyer)\nJames (CIO): \"Integration requirements? Security model?\"\n\nYour Solution Architect (on call):\n\nIntegration:\n- API: REST + GraphQL\n- Auth: OAuth 2.0 / SAML SSO\n- CRM: Salesforce, Dynamics (pre-built connectors)\n- ERP: Deltek CostPoint (custom connector available)\n\nSecurity:\n- SOC2 Type II\n- ISO 27001\n- FedRAMP Moderate (in progress)\n- On-premise deployment option (for classified data)\n\nData residency: AWS US East (GovCloud available)\nJames: \"Good. Send me your security docs for review.\"\n\nResult: Security review passed (Day 45)\n\nDay 60: Meeting with CFO (Financial Approver)\nLisa (CFO): \"What's the total cost?\"\n\nYou: \"Let me break it down...\"\n\n3-Year TCO:\n\nYear 1:\n- OPTR subscription: $300,000\n- Implementation: $50,000 (data migration, training)\n- Total: $350,000\n\nYear 2:\n- Subscription: $300,000\n\nYear 3:\n- Subscription: $300,000\n\n3-Year Total: $950,000\n\nAlternative (continue manual process):\n- Labor cost: 20 captures × 15 weeks × $150/hour × 40 hours = $1,800,000/year\n- 3-Year Total: $5,400,000\n\nNet savings with OPTR: $5,400,000 - $950,000 = $4,450,000 over 3 years\nLisa: \"Approved. Mike, coordinate with procurement to get the PO.\"\n\nDay 90: Procurement / Legal Review\nProcurement: \"We need to add standard terms (indemnification, liability caps, etc.).\"\n\nYou: \"Happy to negotiate.

We evaluated OPTR 6 months ago but went with Loopio.\n\nBig mistake. Loopio is terrible. Support is slow, features don't work.\n\nAre you still willing to work with us? Or did we burn that bridge?\n\nThanks,\nLarry\nYour Response (same day):\n\nHi Larry,\n\nGood to hear from you! No bridge burned - we'd love to work together.\n\nWhat's not working with Loopio?\n\nAvailable for a call tomorrow?\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\nDay 2: Re-Discovery Call (30 minutes)\nYou: \"Larry, walk me through what happened with Loopio.\"\n\nLarry:\n\nWe signed a 2-year contract. $60K/year.\n\nProblems:\n1. Setup took 3 months (they said 2 weeks)\n2. Manual tagging is a nightmare (100+ hours)\n3. Their AI doesn't work (just keyword search)\n4. Support tickets take 1 week to resolve\n\nWe've wasted 6 months and $30K. I'm ready to switch.\nYou: \"What's your Loopio contract situation?\"\n\nLarry: \"18 months left. $30K early termination fee.\"\n\nYou: \"Let's make switching easy...\"\n\nSwitching Offer:\n\n1. We'll pay Loopio termination fee: $30,000\n2. We'll migrate your Loopio library: Free (normally $10K)\n3. First 6 months at 50% off: Save $22,500\n4. If unhappy after 90 days, full refund\n\nYour net cost Year 1: $22,500 (vs. $60K with Loopio)\nSavings: $37,500\nLarry: \"Yes!

Send the contract.\"\n\nDay 30: Contract Signed (after Loopio terminated)\nDeal Metrics:\n\nRe-engagement cycle: 30 days\nACV: $15,000 (Year 1), $90,000 (Year 2+)\nCAC: $32,500 (termination fee + credits)\nLTV: $270,000 (3-year expected retention)\nLTV:CAC: 8.3:1\nKey Lesson: Lost deals aren't dead.
