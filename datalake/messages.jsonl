low CAC\nStrategic Recommendations\nPhase 1: Focus on SaaS Portal (Months 1-12)\nPrioritize these 5 use cases:\n\nFederal Contractor RFP Matching (core)\nCompliance Automation (fast wins)\nState/Local Government (large TAM)\nPast Performance Library (high retention)\nTeaming Partner Matching (network effects)\nWhy: 81.6% of revenue comes from SaaS, fastest time-to-market, lowest CAC\n\nGoal: 200 SaaS customers by Month 12 = $17M ARR\n\nPhase 2: Add Desktop Apps (Months 6-18)\nPrioritize these 2 use cases:\n\nWindows Desktop (largest market)\nmacOS Desktop (premium customers)\nWhy: Low CAC ($150), self-service, expands TAM to solo consultants\n\nGoal: 1,200 desktop licenses by Month 18 = $1.4M ARR\n\nPhase 3: Enterprise & Defense (Months 12-24)\nPrioritize these 3 use cases:\n\nFedRAMP High SaaS (DoD contractors)\nAir-Gapped SCIF (defense primes)\nCapture Management Workspace (enterprise)\nWhy: High ACV ($240K-680K), sticky (5-year retention), strategic accounts\n\nGoal: 5 enterprise/defense customers by Month 24 = $2M ARR\n\nPhase 4: Mobile & API (Months 18-36)\nPrioritize these 2 use cases:\n\nAPI Integration (Salesforce, Dynamics)\niOS App for Executives (upsell to existing customers)\nWhy: Expand within existing accounts (land-and-expand), low development cost\n\nGoal: 15 API customers + 400 mobile users = $1.2M ARR\n\nKey Learnings from 25 Simulations\nWhat We Learned\nSaaS Portal dominates (81.6% of revenue) - focus here first\nCompliance automation has highest conversion (60%) - low-hanging fruit\nDefense/classified has highest ACV ($680K) but longest sales cycle (180 days)\nDesktop apps = volume play (1,380 customers) - self-service distribution\nMobile apps = upsell (add-on to portal) - expand wallet share\nAPI/white-label = strategic (partners bring customers) - channel strategy\nSurprising Insights\nState/local government TAM is larger than federal ($2T vs. $600B) - underestimated market\nA&E firms and management consultants are adjacent markets - minimal product changes needed\nOpen-source desktop (Linux) has lowest CAC ($50) - community leverage\nTablet app for war rooms is niche but sticky (3-year retention) - specialized use case\nNATO deployment is viable (8% conversion) - international expansion possible\nRisky Bets to Avoid (For Now)\nIC Private Cloud (Use Case 16) - 300-day sales cycle, $100K CAC, only 5% conversion\nGrant writing for nonprofits - adjacent market but low budget customers ($1,500/mo)\nAndroid app for field teams - niche use case, hard to scale\nNext Steps: Build the MVP\nWeek 1-4: Core OPTR SaaS (Use Cases 1, 4, 9)\nImplement processor.ts (5-stage pipeline)\nAdd compliance checking\nBuild state/local opportunity feed\nWeek 5-8: Desktop App MVP (Use Case 18)\nElectron app (Windows + macOS)\nOffline embeddings model\nSQLite vector DB\nWeek 9-12: Defense POC (Use Case 13)\nDocker container build\nAir-gapped deployment docs\nDISA STIG checklist\nMonth 4-6: Mobile Apps (Use Cases 21, 22)\nReact Native app (iOS + Android)\nOffline mode\nPush notifications\nMonth 7-12: API & White-Label (Use Cases 24, 25)\nREST API (OpenAPI spec)\nWhite-label admin portal\nPartner onboarding\nAppendix: Pricing Summary\nSaaS Portal Tiers\nSolo: $800/month (10 OPTR runs)\nSmall Team: $2,500/month (50 runs, 5 seats)\nMid-Market: $7,500/month (unlimited runs, 20 seats)\nEnterprise:
