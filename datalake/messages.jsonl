Everything stays on-premise.\n\nWhat's your security model? Need full details before I'll consider.\nDay 5: Technical Deep-Dive Call (45 minutes)\nAttendees: Sam (CIO), Your Security Engineer, You (AE)\n\nSam: \"Walk me through your data flow. Where does our RFP data go?\"\n\nYour Security Engineer:\n\nGreat question. Let me show you our architecture:\n\n1. Data ingestion: Your RFP uploads are encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)\n2. Storage: Encrypted at rest (AES-256) in your dedicated database partition\n3. Processing: Embeddings generated in isolated containers (no data sharing between customers)\n4. Vector DB: Your data is logically separated (tenant isolation)\n5. Access control: Role-based (only your team sees your data)\n\nWe're SOC2 Type II certified. Here's our security whitepaper.\nSam: \"What about OpenAI? You send our data to OpenAI for embeddings?\"\n\nYour Security Engineer:\n\nYes, but with safeguards:\n- We use OpenAI's API with BAA (Business Associate Agreement)\n- OpenAI doesn't train models on customer data (contractually prohibited)\n- We can deploy on-premise if you prefer (no external API calls)\n\nFor classified work, we offer air-gapped deployment:\n- Docker container runs on your infrastructure\n- Embeddings model runs locally (no internet connection)\n- Vector DB on-premise (pgvector on your Postgres)\n- Zero telemetry / phone-home\nSam: \"How much for on-premise?\"\n\nYou: \"One-time setup: $100K. Annual support: $30K. Your data never leaves your network.\"\n\nSam: \"Too expensive. What about FedRAMP?\"\n\nYou:\n\nWe're in the FedRAMP authorization process (JAB P-ATO expected Q2 2026).\n\nFor now, we offer FedRAMP-equivalent controls:\n- Deploy in AWS GovCloud (IL4/IL5)\n- FIPS 140-2 validated encryption\n- Continuous monitoring (ConMon)\n- Annual penetration testing (results shared)\n\nPrice: $15K/month (2× premium over standard SaaS)\nSam: \"Let me review your security docs and get back to you.\"\n\nResult: ✅ Security review scheduled (Day 15)\n\nDay 15: Security Review Meeting (90 minutes)\nAttendees: Sam (CIO), Sam's Security Architect, Your CISO, You\n\nSam's Architect: \"I reviewed your SOC2 report. Few questions...\"\n\nQ1: \"What's your incident response time SLA?\" A: \"Critical incidents: 1 hour acknowledgment, 4 hours resolution. We'll add this to your contract.\"\n\nQ2: \"What happens if there's a breach?\" A: \"We carry $10M cyber insurance. Plus, contractual liability for breach notification within 24 hours.\"\n\nQ3: \"Can we audit your code?\" A: \"For enterprise customers, yes. We provide source code escrow + annual security code review.\"\n\nSam's Architect: \"Impressed. I'll recommend approval.\"\n\nSam: \"Okay. Send me a pilot proposal. 90 days, 5 users, full security features.\"\n\nResult: ✅ Pilot proposal sent (Day 20)\n\nDay 30: Pilot Kickoff\nPilot Terms:\n\nDuration: 90 days\nUsers: 5 proposal writers\nPricing: $5,000 for pilot (applied to annual contract if they convert)\nSuccess criteria:\nZero security incidents\n30%+ time savings validated\nPass internal security audit\nDay 60: Mid-Pilot Check-In\nUsage Stats:\n\n12 OPTR runs completed\n0 security incidents\nAverage time savings: 37.2 hours per proposal (93% reduction)\nUser satisfaction: 4.8/5\nSam: \"Team loves it. Security audit passed. What's the annual price?\"\n\nYou:\n\nBased on your usage:\n- Mid-Market tier: $7,500/month × 12 = $90,000/year\n- Includes: Unlimited runs, 20 user seats, priority support\n- Less $5K pilot credit = $85,000 first year\n\nAdd-ons available:\n- FedRAMP deployment: +$180K/year (+$15K/month)\n- On-premise option: +$130K/year ($100K setup + $30K support)\n\nWhich deployment model do you prefer?\nSam: \"Standard SaaS is fine. We'll add FedRAMP next year when you have the authorization.\"\n\nDay 90: Pilot Complete → Contract Signed\nFinal Terms:\n\nStandard SaaS: $85,000/year (first year with credit)\nYear 2+: $90,000/year\nContract: 3-year commitment\nSLA: 99.9% uptime, 4-hour critical incident response\nSecurity: SOC2 Type II annual audit (reports shared)\nExpansion option: FedRAMP upgrade available when authorized\nSam: \"Approved. Let's get the contract signed.\"\n\nDeal Metrics:\n\nSales cycle: 90 days (discovery → close)\nACV: $85,000 (Year 1), $90,000 (Year 2+)\nCAC: $12,000 (security review + pilot)\nLTV: $270,000 (3-year contract)\nLTV:CAC: 22.5:1\nKey Lesson: Security-conscious customers need deep technical validation. Invest in security docs upfront.\n\nScenario 2: \"Frugal Fran\" — Startup on Tight Budget\nCustomer Profile\nName: Fran Martinez\nTitle: Founder/CEO\nCompany: AgileDefense (startup, 2 years old)\nRevenue: $2M annually\nEmployees: 8 (no dedicated proposal staff)\nPain: Can't afford $800/month (\"That's 10% of our OpEx!\")\nObjection: \"Too expensive for a startup\"\nTimeline: 15 Days (Discovery → Close with Discount)\nDay 1: Inbound Demo Request (Website)\nFran's Form Submission:\n\nCompany: AgileDefense\nRevenue: $2M\nEmployees: 8\nUse case: \"Need to bid on more contracts but don't have time\"\nBudget: $200-500/month\nYour SDR Response (same day):\n\nHi Fran,\n\nThanks for your interest! I see you're looking for proposal acceleration.\n\nQuick clarification: How many proposals do you bid on per year?\n\nOur pricing starts at $800/month, but we have startup programs for \ncompanies under $5M revenue.\n\nAvailable for a 20-minute call tomorrow?\n\nBest,\n[Your SDR]\nFran's Reply:\n\nWe bid on ~6-8 proposals/year. $800/month is 48% of our target profit margin!\n\nCan you do $300/month? I can't justify more.\nDay 2: Discovery Call (30 minutes)\nYou: \"Fran, walk me through your proposal process today.\"\n\nFran:\n\nIt's chaos. I'm the CEO but I also write proposals (no budget for writers).\n\nEach RFP takes me 40-50 hours. I bill at $200/hour as a consultant, \nso every proposal costs me $8-10K in opportunity cost.\n\nI turned down 10 opportunities last year because I didn't have time.\nYou: \"Let's do the math together...\"\n\nROI Calculation (live on screen):\n\nYour current state:\n- Proposals: 6/year\n- Time per proposal: 40 hours\n- Opportunity cost: $200/hour\n- Total annual cost: 6 × 40 × $200 = $48,000\n\nWith OPTR:\n- Time per proposal: 5 hours (saving 35 hours)\n- Annual time saved: 6 × 35 = 210 hours\n- Value: 210 × $200 = $42,000\n\nOPTR cost: $800/month × 12 = $9,600\nNet benefit: $42,000 - $9,600 = $32,400\n\nPlus, you can bid on those 10 missed opportunities:\n- Additional proposals: 10\n- Win rate (conservative): 20%\n- Expected wins: 2 contracts\n- Avg contract value: $500K\n- Profit margin: 20%\n- Additional profit: 2 × $500K × 20% = $200,000\n\nTotal benefit: $32,400 + $200,000 = $232,400\nROI: 2,421%\nFran: \"Okay, the math works. But I still can't afford $9,600 upfront. Cash flow is tight.\"\n\nYou: \"What if we structured it differently?\"\n\nDay 3: Creative Deal Structure\nProposal:\n\nStartup Accelerator Program:\n\nYear 1 Pricing (discounted):\n- $300/month × 12 = $3,600/year\n- Conditions:\n  1. You must be <$5M revenue (verified annually)\n  2. You give us a testimonial + case study after 6 months\n  3. Logo on our website as customer\n  4. You graduate to standard pricing ($800/month) at $5M revenue\n\nYear 2+ Pricing:\n- If revenue <$5M: $400/month ($4,800/year)\n- If revenue >$5M: $800/month ($9,600/year)\n\nWhy we offer this:\n- We want startups to grow with OPTR\n- Your success = our success (you'll buy more seats as you scale)\n- Your testimonial helps us sign more startups\nFran: \"This is perfect. Can I start immediately?\"\n\nYou: \"Yes. I'll send the contract today. Welcome to OPTR!\"\n\nDay 5: Contract Signed\nFinal Terms:\n\nYear 1: $3,600 ($300/month)\nIncludes: 10 OPTR runs/month, 3 user seats, email support\nTestimonial due: Month 6\nAuto-upgrade to $800/month when revenue >$5M\nDeal Metrics:\n\nSales cycle: 5 days (fastest!)\nACV: $3,600 (Year 1)\nCAC: $500 (mostly self-service)\nExpected LTV: $50,000 (assumes growth to $5M+ in Year 3)\nLTV:CAC: 100:1\nKey Lesson: Don't lose deals over price. Create tiered programs for budget-conscious customers. Land & expand strategy.\n\nScenario 3: \"Demanding Donna\" — Wants Custom Features\nCustomer Profile\nName: Donna Williams\nTitle: VP of Proposals\nCompany: MegaCorp Defense\nRevenue: $1.2B annually\nEmployees: 2,000 (50 proposal writers)\nPain: \"Your product is 80% of what we need.

But I still can't afford $9,600 upfront.

low CAC\nStrategic Recommendations\nPhase 1: Focus on SaaS Portal (Months 1-12)\nPrioritize these 5 use cases:\n\nFederal Contractor RFP Matching (core)\nCompliance Automation (fast wins)\nState/Local Government (large TAM)\nPast Performance Library (high retention)\nTeaming Partner Matching (network effects)\nWhy: 81.6% of revenue comes from SaaS, fastest time-to-market, lowest CAC\n\nGoal: 200 SaaS customers by Month 12 = $17M ARR\n\nPhase 2: Add Desktop Apps (Months 6-18)\nPrioritize these 2 use cases:\n\nWindows Desktop (largest market)\nmacOS Desktop (premium customers)\nWhy: Low CAC ($150), self-service, expands TAM to solo consultants\n\nGoal: 1,200 desktop licenses by Month 18 = $1.4M ARR\n\nPhase 3: Enterprise & Defense (Months 12-24)\nPrioritize these 3 use cases:\n\nFedRAMP High SaaS (DoD contractors)\nAir-Gapped SCIF (defense primes)\nCapture Management Workspace (enterprise)\nWhy: High ACV ($240K-680K), sticky (5-year retention), strategic accounts\n\nGoal: 5 enterprise/defense customers by Month 24 = $2M ARR\n\nPhase 4: Mobile & API (Months 18-36)\nPrioritize these 2 use cases:\n\nAPI Integration (Salesforce, Dynamics)\niOS App for Executives (upsell to existing customers)\nWhy: Expand within existing accounts (land-and-expand), low development cost\n\nGoal: 15 API customers + 400 mobile users = $1.2M ARR\n\nKey Learnings from 25 Simulations\nWhat We Learned\nSaaS Portal dominates (81.6% of revenue) - focus here first\nCompliance automation has highest conversion (60%) - low-hanging fruit\nDefense/classified has highest ACV ($680K) but longest sales cycle (180 days)\nDesktop apps = volume play (1,380 customers) - self-service distribution\nMobile apps = upsell (add-on to portal) - expand wallet share\nAPI/white-label = strategic (partners bring customers) - channel strategy\nSurprising Insights\nState/local government TAM is larger than federal ($2T vs. $600B) - underestimated market\nA&E firms and management consultants are adjacent markets - minimal product changes needed\nOpen-source desktop (Linux) has lowest CAC ($50) - community leverage\nTablet app for war rooms is niche but sticky (3-year retention) - specialized use case\nNATO deployment is viable (8% conversion) - international expansion possible\nRisky Bets to Avoid (For Now)\nIC Private Cloud (Use Case 16) - 300-day sales cycle, $100K CAC, only 5% conversion\nGrant writing for nonprofits - adjacent market but low budget customers ($1,500/mo)\nAndroid app for field teams - niche use case, hard to scale\nNext Steps: Build the MVP\nWeek 1-4: Core OPTR SaaS (Use Cases 1, 4, 9)\nImplement processor.ts (5-stage pipeline)\nAdd compliance checking\nBuild state/local opportunity feed\nWeek 5-8: Desktop App MVP (Use Case 18)\nElectron app (Windows + macOS)\nOffline embeddings model\nSQLite vector DB\nWeek 9-12: Defense POC (Use Case 13)\nDocker container build\nAir-gapped deployment docs\nDISA STIG checklist\nMonth 4-6: Mobile Apps (Use Cases 21,
