## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

### **Demo Strategy**

1. **Lead with the gap:** Show that Constitutional AI is aspirational, not mechanical
2. **Show, don't tell:** Live demo beats slides every time
3. **Follow the money:** Always tie back to $450M-750M TAM
4. **Prove it works:** Real metrics, real customers, real compliance artifacts

### **Pitch Strategy**

1. **Frame as infrastructure, not product:** "Missing piece to make Constitutional AI defensible"
2. **Create urgency:** DoD Q2 2026 deadline is real
3. **Show competitive threat:** OpenAI/Google catching up (eventually)
4. **De-risk decision:** Production-ready, proven, integrated in <1 week

### **Negotiation Strategy**

1. **Anchor high:** $100M-150M starting point
2. **Justify with 3-year value:** $857M-1.847B
3. **Highlight alternatives:** Build internally = 18-24 months, miss DoD wave
4. **Emphasize exclusivity:** 30-day validation period locks out competitors
