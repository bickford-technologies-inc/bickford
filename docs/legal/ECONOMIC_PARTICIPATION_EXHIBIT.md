## Section 1: Economic Participation Rights

### 1.1 Participation Percentage
Participant shall be entitled to **0.30%** (thirty basis points) of Company Valuation (as defined below) upon occurrence of a Valuation Event (as defined below), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

### 1.2 Company Valuation
"**Company Valuation**" means the fully diluted enterprise value of Company, calculated as follows:

**(a) IPO Valuation Event**:
```
Company Valuation = Closing Stock Price × Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding
```
Where:
- Closing Stock Price = closing price on first day of public trading
- Fully Diluted Shares = all outstanding shares, options, warrants, RSUs, convertible securities (on as-converted basis)

**(b) Acquisition/Merger Valuation Event**:
```
Company Valuation = Transaction Enterprise Value
```
Where:
- Transaction Enterprise Value = purchase price paid for Company (including all cash, stock, earn-outs, and assumed liabilities)

**(c) Secondary Sale Valuation Event**:
```
Company Valuation = Secondary Sale Price Per Share × Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding
```
Where:
- Secondary Sale Price Per Share = weighted average price paid in secondary transaction(s) exceeding 5% of Company's fully diluted shares in any 12-month period

**(d) Periodic Settlement Valuation Event**:
```
Company Valuation = Independent Third-Party Valuation
```
Where:
- Independent Third-Party Valuation = valuation conducted by mutually agreed appraiser (or, if no agreement, by Big 4 accounting firm selected by coin flip)

### 1.3 Valuation Event
"**Valuation Event**" means the occurrence of any of the following:

1. **IPO**: Company's initial public offering of common stock on a nationally recognized securities exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)

2. **Acquisition/Merger**: Sale of substantially all of Company's assets or equity to third party (>50% ownership transfer)

3. **Secondary Sale**: Transaction(s) in which >5% of Company's fully diluted shares are sold to third parties in any consecutive 12-month period at materially higher valuation than previous round

4. **Periodic Settlement**: If no Valuation Event occurs within 5 years of Effective Date, Company shall initiate Independent Third-Party Valuation process, repeating every 5 years thereafter until Valuation Event occurs

5. **Put Right** (Year 7+): After 7th anniversary of Effective Date, Participant may trigger Independent Third-Party Valuation once per year

---

## Section 2: Payment Mechanics

### 2.1 Payment Calculation
Upon occurrence of a Valuation Event, Company shall pay Participant in cash:

```
Payment Amount = (Participation % × Company Valuation) - Initial Cash Consideration
```

Where:
- Participation % = 0.30%
- Company Valuation = determined per Section 1.2
- Initial Cash Consideration = $25,000,000 (upfront payment per Purchase Agreement)

**Example Calculation**:
```
Scenario: Company IPO at $15B valuation
Payment Amount = (0.30% × $15,000,000,000) - $25,000,000
Payment Amount = $45,000,000 - $25,000,000
Payment Amount = $20,000,000 additional payment to Participant
```

### 2.2 Payment Timing
- **IPO**: Payment within 90 days of first trading day
- **Acquisition/Merger**: Payment within 90 days of transaction closing
- **Secondary Sale**: Payment within 90 days of transaction settlement
- **Periodic Settlement / Put Right**: Payment within 90 days of final valuation determination

### 2.3 Payment Method
All payments shall be made via wire transfer to Participant's designated bank account (to be provided in writing within 30 days of Effective Date).

### 2.4 No Clawback
Once paid, amounts shall not be subject to clawback, refund, or return under any circumstances (including subsequent down-rounds, bankruptcy, or business failures).

---

## Section 3: Valuation Dispute Resolution

### 3.1 Good Faith Valuation
Company shall calculate Company Valuation in good faith using standard valuation methodologies. For IPO and Acquisition events, valuation is determined by market/transaction terms and not subject to dispute.

### 3.2 Dispute Process (Periodic Settlement / Put Right Only)
If Participant disputes Independent Third-Party Valuation:

1. Participant must notify Company in writing within 30 days of receiving valuation report
2. Parties shall attempt to resolve dispute through good-faith negotiation for 15 days
3. If unresolved, parties shall jointly retain second Independent Third-Party Appraiser
4. Second appraiser's valuation shall be binding and final
5. Costs of second appraisal split 50/50 between parties

### 3.3 Binding Nature
Subject to Section 3.2, all valuation determinations are final and binding. Participant waives right to challenge IPO market cap or Acquisition transaction value.

---

## Section 4: Nature of Rights

### 4.1 Contractual Payment Obligation Only
The rights granted herein constitute a contractual payment obligation only. Participant receives:
- ✅ Economic participation in Company Valuation
- ❌ No equity ownership or stock
- ❌ No voting rights
- ❌ No board observation or governance rights
- ❌ No information rights (beyond valuation notices)
- ❌ No management participation

### 4.2 Not a Security
The parties intend for this Agreement to constitute a cash-settled payment obligation and **not** a security under federal or state securities laws. Key distinguishing factors:
- Cash-settled (no equity issued)
- Non-transferable (personal to Participant)
- Fixed formula (no discretionary adjustments)
- No common enterprise participation

### 4.3 Non-Transferability
Participant may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or encumber these rights. Any attempted transfer is void. Rights are personal to Participant and terminate upon Participant's death or dissolution (with final payment to estate/successors).

---

## Section 5: Dilution Protection

### 5.1 Fully Diluted Calculation
Participation percentage (0.30%) is calculated on **fully diluted basis**, meaning:
- All outstanding common stock
- All outstanding preferred stock (on as-converted basis)
- All outstanding options, warrants, RSUs (whether vested or unvested)
- All convertible securities (notes, SAFEs, etc.) on as-converted basis
- All shares reserved for future issuance (option pools, etc.)

### 5.2 Anti-Dilution Protection
Future equity issuances (fundraising, employee stock options, etc.) do **not** reduce Participant's participation percentage. The 0.30% is fixed and immutable.

**Example**:
```
At Closing: 100M fully diluted shares
Participant Participation = 0.30% of valuation

After Series D (20M new shares issued): 120M fully diluted shares
Participant Participation = still 0.30% of valuation (not reduced to 0.25%)
```

---

## Section 6: Termination

### 6.1 Termination Events
This Agreement terminates upon:

1. **Full Payment at Valuation Event**: After final payment following IPO, Acquisition, or other Valuation Event
2. **Mutual Written Agreement**: If both parties agree in writing to terminate
3. **Company Bankruptcy/Dissolution**: If Company files for bankruptcy or dissolves (no payment obligation survives)

### 6.2 Survival of Payment Obligations
If Valuation Event occurs prior to termination, Company's payment obligation survives and must be paid per Section 2.2 even if Company subsequently dissolves.

## Appendix A: Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful IPO at $20B
- Company Valuation = $20B
- Participation Value = 0.30% × $20B = $60M
- Less Initial Payment = $60M - $25M = **$35M additional payment**
- Total Seller Proceeds = $25M + $35M = **$60M**

### Scenario 2: Acquisition at $8B (Below Break-Even)
- Company Valuation = $8B
- Participation Value = 0.30% × $8B = $24M
- Less Initial Payment = $24M - $25M = **($1M)**
- Payment = $0 (no additional payment, but no clawback of initial $25M)
- Total Seller Proceeds = **$25M** (initial payment only)

### Scenario 3: Periodic Settlement at $12B (No IPO After 5 Years)
- Independent valuation determines $12B Company Valuation
- Participation Value = 0.30% × $12B = $36M
- Less Initial Payment = $36M - $25M = **$11M additional payment**
- Total Seller Proceeds = $25M + $11M = **$36M**

### Scenario 4: Mega IPO at $100B
- Company Valuation = $100B
- Participation Value = 0.30% × $100B = $300M
- Less Initial Payment = $300M - $25M = **$275M additional payment**
- Total Seller Proceeds = $25M + $275M = **$300M**
