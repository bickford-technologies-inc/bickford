# Board Presentation: Drift‑Focused Acquisition Deck (15 Slides)

**Theme:** Two‑Layer Drift Prevention (Neural + Execution)  
**Target:** Anthropic Board  
**Timing:** 20 minutes + Q&A

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**Bickford → Anthropic Acquisition**  
Subtitle: *Completing the drift‑prevention architecture*

---

## Slide 2 — The Strategic Problem
**Drift is the core risk.**  
Anthropic’s Assistant Axis research shows models drift from helpful persona during conversations. Activation capping reduces harmful outputs by ~50%.

**Thesis:** Neural drift prevention is necessary — but not sufficient for regulated markets.

---

## Slide 3 — Two‑Layer Drift Prevention Architecture
```
Layer 1: Neural Drift Prevention (Assistant Axis - shipped)
  → Prevents model behavior drift
Layer 2: Execution Drift Prevention (Bickford - acquire)
  → Prevents governance drift with cryptographic enforcement
```
**Result:** Only platform with drift prevention at both neural and execution layers.

---

## Slide 4 — What Regulators Require (Today)
**Without Bickford:**
- No cryptographic audit trail
- No independent verification
- No proof of runtime compliance

**With Bickford:**
- Cryptographic proof chain per decision
- Independently verifiable ledger
- Tamper‑evident enforcement

---

## Slide 5 — Live Demo: “Same Prompt, Different Proof”
**Claude alone:** Safe outputs, unverifiable  
**Claude + Bickford:** Safe outputs + proof chain + regulator‑ready evidence

---

## Slide 6 — Technical Architecture (1‑Slide Summary)
- Pre‑execution enforcement
- Post‑execution verification
- 4‑part cryptographic proof chain
- Tamper‑evident ledger
- <100ms latency overhead target

---

## Slide 7 — Financial Impact (Year 1)
| Category | Value |
|---|---|
| Cost savings | $34.64M |
| Revenue enablement | $255M–$585M |
| **Total Year 1** | **$289.64M–$619.64M** |

---

## Slide 8 — Financial Impact (3‑Year)
| Category | Value |
|---|---|
| Cost savings | $91.92M |
| Revenue enablement | $765M–$1.755B |
| **Total 3‑Year** | **$857M–$1.847B** |

---

## Slide 9 — Acquisition Economics
| Price Range | Multiple (Year 1 Value) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| $25M–$50M | 0.7–1.4x | Extremely attractive |
| **$50M–$100M** | **1.4–2.9x** | **Recommended** |
| $100M–$150M | 2.9–4.3x | Defensible |

**Payback:** <3 months (cost savings alone)

---

## Slide 10 — Competitive Moat (36–42 Months)
- Competitors must replicate Assistant Axis + Constitutional AI + runtime enforcement
- Combined lead: **36–42 months**
- Anthropic becomes the only platform with provable drift prevention at both layers

---

## Slide 11 — Regulated Market Unlock
- **Defense:** $120M–$240M/year (DoD Q2 2026 wave)
- **Healthcare:** $75M–$175M/year (HIPAA automation)
- **Financial:** $60M–$170M/year (SOC‑2/PCI acceleration)

**Total unlock:** $255M–$585M/year

---

## Slide 12 — Risk Mitigation
- Latency overhead measured and bounded
- Wrapper architecture isolates Claude API changes
- Ledger verification detects tampering immediately
- Plug‑and‑play integration (<1 week pilot)

---

## Slide 13 — 90‑Day Integration Plan
1. **Week 1:** POC deployment + metrics
2. **Weeks 2–4:** Design partner validation
3. **Weeks 5–8:** Compliance artifacts + regulator feedback
4. **Weeks 9–12:** Production rollout

---

## Slide 14 — The Ask
**30‑day exclusivity for technical validation**  
- Week 1: Deploy POC, measure latency
- Week 2: Run 3 design partner pilots
- Week 3: Compliance artifact generation
- Week 4: Board decision

---

## Slide 15 — Summary / Decision
**Acquire Bickford to complete Anthropic’s drift‑prevention stack.**  
- Only platform with provable drift prevention at neural + execution layers
- $857M–$1.847B 3‑year value
- $50M–$100M acquisition is highly accretive

**Decision:** Approve 30‑day validation → Acquire → Deploy by Q2 2026
