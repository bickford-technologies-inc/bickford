# Why AI ROI Is an Execution Problem
*(Not a Model Problem)*

---

## What Boards Expect
- Faster decisions
- Higher confidence in outcomes
- Measurable ROI from AI spend

---

## What Actually Happens
- Models improve, but results don’t compound
- Decisions stall between analysis and action
- Teams repeatedly rebuild the same logic
- Governance slows deployment instead of enabling it

---

## The Root Cause
> **Decisions decay.**

Context, authority, and rationale are lost as work moves across teams, time, and systems.  
AI produces insights — but execution resets every cycle, so compounding never starts.

---

## Why This Matters
- **High-consequence domains** (insurance, finance, defense) value *confidence* over sophistication
- ROI is driven by **friction removal**, not better algorithms
- Stability over time is more valuable than marginal accuracy gains
- Continuous compounding comes from repeatable execution, not one-off wins

---

## The Fix
**Decision continuity.**

Encode intent, authority, and constraints directly into execution so decisions:
- survive scrutiny
- remain explainable
- replay without re-derivation
- compound value over time, continuously

---

## Board Takeaway
AI does not fail because models are weak.  
It fails because **execution is not preserved**.

> **The competitive advantage is not intelligence — it’s durable execution.**

## Business-Process Workflows (Real Use Cases)
- Underwriting triage, pricing approvals, claims adjudication (insurance)
- Credit risk overrides, fraud review, KYC refreshes (banking)
- Revenue forecasting, pipeline qualification, discount governance (sales)
- Deal desk approvals, contract clause compliance (legal/commercial)
- Supply chain exception handling, inventory rebalancing (operations)
- Field service dispatch, spare-parts allocation (manufacturing)
- Clinical trial site selection, adverse-event review (life sciences)
- Incident triage, change approvals, postmortem actioning (IT/SRE)

## ROI Measurement (USD per Hour) — Comprehensive Groupings
Measure value as **$ / hour saved or gained**, normalized by:
- Region (country, metro, plant, data center, campus)
- Business unit (P&L, product line, segment)
- Sales region (geo, territory, vertical)
- Function (finance, legal, HR, ops, engineering, IT, security)
- Workflow (process name, stage, queue)
- Role (title, band, cost center)
- Team (pod, squad, center of excellence)
- KPI set (throughput, error rate, cycle time, compliance rate)
- Customer tier (enterprise, mid-market, SMB)
- Channel (direct, partner, marketplace)
- Risk class (low/medium/high consequence)
- Control set (policy, audit, approval chain)
- System boundary (ERP, CRM, HRIS, data lake)
- Time window (hour/day/week/quarter)
- Margin class (gross margin, contribution margin)
- Geography/regulatory regime (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Contract type (fixed, usage-based, outcome-based)
- Asset type (capex-intensive, opex-intensive)
- Employee cohort (new hire, tenured, frontline, back office)
