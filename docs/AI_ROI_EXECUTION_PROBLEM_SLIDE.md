# Why AI ROI Is an Execution Problem
*(Not a Model Problem)*

---

## What Boards Expect
- Faster decisions
- Higher confidence in outcomes
- Measurable ROI from AI spend

---

## What Actually Happens
- Models improve, but results don’t compound
- Decisions stall between analysis and action
- Teams repeatedly rebuild the same logic
- Governance slows deployment instead of enabling it

---

## The Root Cause
> **Decisions decay.**

Context, authority, and rationale are lost as work moves across teams, time, and systems.  
AI produces insights — but execution resets every cycle.

---

## Why This Matters
- **High-consequence domains** (insurance, finance, defense) value *confidence* over sophistication
- ROI is driven by **friction removal**, not better algorithms
- Stability over time is more valuable than marginal accuracy gains

---

## The Fix
**Decision continuity.**

Encode intent, authority, and constraints directly into execution so decisions:
- survive scrutiny
- remain explainable
- replay without re-derivation
- compound value over time

---

## Board Takeaway
AI does not fail because models are weak.  
It fails because **execution is not preserved**.

> **The competitive advantage is not intelligence — it’s durable execution.**
