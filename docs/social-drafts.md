# Social Post Drafts: Copilot Acquisition Moat

---

## Hacker News

> We made it architecturally impossible to violate our AI compliance rules—by encoding our entire enforcement/compression logic in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Every Copilot suggestion is Bun-native, dual-purpose, and hash-chained. 99.98% compression at Anthropic scale. This is how you build a moat in 2026. [Blog link]

> Tired of "AI compliance" that can be bypassed? We made it impossible. Our Copilot instructions file enforces Bun-native, dual-purpose, hash-chained, and compressed code—automatically. $18M+/yr storage savings at scale. See the moat: [Blog link]

> 🚀 We turned GitHub Copilot into an acquisition moat. Every suggestion is Bun-native, dual-purpose (compliance + intelligence), and 99.98% compressed. External verifiability, $18M+/yr savings, and architectural enforcement—by design. Read how: [Blog link]

## How-to-Use Snippets

```typescript
// Ledger append with compression
async function appendToLedger(entry: LedgerEntry) {
  // ...see blog for full pattern...
}
```

```typescript
// Dual-purpose compliance + RAG
await ledger.append({ eventType: "completion", payload: { ... }, embedding: await generateEmbedding(query) });
```
