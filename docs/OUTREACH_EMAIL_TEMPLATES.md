# Outreach Email Templates: Bickford Acquisition

## Template A: Warm Introduction (Preferred)

Subject: Unlocking Regulated Markets for Anthropic – Warm Intro

Hi [Contact],

I’m reaching out via [mutual connection] regarding a breakthrough in Constitutional AI enforcement that directly addresses the Assistant Axis drift problem. We’ve built a cryptographic enforcement layer that:

- Prevents governance drift at runtime
- Generates regulator-verifiable proof chains
- Automates SOC-2/ISO compliance artifacts

Demo video: [insert Loom/YouTube link]
Executive summary: attached (ONE_PAGE_SUMMARY.pdf)

Would love to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss how this can unlock $450M+ in regulated markets for Anthropic.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template B: Cold Email

Subject: Anthropic: Cryptographic AI Compliance (Demo Inside)

Hi [Contact],

I’m the founder of Bickford. We’ve solved the Constitutional AI enforcement gap with a cryptographic proof chain that regulators can independently verify—no Anthropic access required. All demos and compliance artifacts are production-ready.

## Template D: Dario Amodei (CEO – Strategic Angle)

Subject: Anthropic + Bickford: 36-Month Moat in Regulated AI

Hi Dario,

We’ve built the only cryptographic Constitutional AI enforcement platform that closes the Assistant Axis drift gap. All demos are production-ready, and compliance artifacts are automated. This creates a 36-42 month moat for Anthropic in regulated markets.

Executive summary: attached

Would love to discuss a pilot or acquisition.
