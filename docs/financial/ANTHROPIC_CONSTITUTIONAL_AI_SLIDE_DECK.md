> **Format:** One slide per section. Use this as slide-ready markdown for conversion to PPT/PDF.

---

## Slide 1 — Title
**Bickford × Anthropic**
**Constitutional AI Enforcement Infrastructure**

Tagline: *Constitutional AI has an enforcement gap. Bickford fills it.*

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem
- Constitutional AI defines principles, but enforcement is still manual.
- Regulated enterprises require provable compliance, not promises.
- Sales cycles stall without audit-grade governance.

---

## Slide 3 — The Enforcement Gap
- Policies exist outside runtime.
- Trust is created by paperwork, not execution proof.
- Compliance cost is high because evidence is retroactive.

---

## Slide 4 — Bickford Solution (What It Is)
**Decision Continuity Runtime**
- Policies become executable constraints.
- Signed execution law prevents unauthorized actions.
- All decisions persist to an immutable ledger.

---

## Slide 5 — Strategic Positioning
**Bickford = Constitutional AI Enforcement Infrastructure**
- Converts governance from policy to law.
- Proof-of-compliance is automatic.
- Enforcement becomes a productized moat.

---

## Slide 6 — Market Expansion (TAM)
**$115B TAM Expansion**
- Defense: $50B
- Healthcare: $25B
- Finance: $40B

Governance is the gatekeeper for regulated markets.

---

## Slide 7 — ROI #1: Sales Velocity
- Sales cycle compresses 9 months → 3 months.
- 2x enterprise sales productivity.
- Governance objections neutralized with runtime evidence.

---

## Slide 8 — ROI #2: Compliance Cost Reduction
- 70–90% compliance cost reduction.
- $1.5M–$4M per regulated market.
- Evidence generated in real time, not retroactively.

---

## Slide 9 — ROI #3: Premium Pricing
- 20–40% premium pricing for governed deployments.
- Compliance as an upsell, not a cost center.

---

## Slide 10 — Competitive Landscape
- **Anthropic + Bickford:** enforcement + trust = durable moat.
- Competing models lack enforcement runtime.
- Enterprises buy outcomes, not just model performance.

---

## Slide 11 — Business Impact (Conservative 3-Year View)
- **Revenue impact:** $500M–$900M cumulative.
- **Cost avoidance:** $10M–$30M annually.
- **Strategic premium:** enforcement infrastructure increases valuation multiple.

---

## Slide 12 — 90-Day Integration Roadmap
**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4):**
- Enforcement ledger + execution law integration.
- Policy import and constraint encoding.

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8):**
- Pilot customer onboarding.
- Audit evidence generation + dashboards.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12):**
- Sales enablement for regulated buyers.
- Pricing and packaging for governance tier.

---

## Slide 13 — Customer Validation Pilot Structure
- 2–3 regulated enterprises.
- Joint success metrics: compliance evidence time, risk reduction, cycle-time impact.
- Co-published governance proof.

---

## Slide 14 — Acquisition / Partnership Framework
- Valuation range: **$25M–$150M + equity**.
- Strategic premium applied for enforceable compliance moat.
- Economics scale with regulated market conversion.

---

## Slide 15 — Next Steps
1. Technical demo of enforcement runtime.
2. Joint pilot design with enterprise prospects.
3. Commercial packaging for governance tier.

---

# Technical Appendix

## Slide 16 — Canonical Model (Intent → Decision → Ledger)
- Intent: **I = (G, Θ, A, τ)**
- Decision: **D = (I, R, E, σ)**
- Ledger: **L_{t+1} = L_t ∪ {(D, h(D), t)}**

---

## Slide 17 — Execution Law
**Executable iff:**
- **a ∈ E**
- **σ ∈ A**
- **a ⊨ Θ**

Otherwise execution is denied and recorded.

---

## Slide 18 — OPTR (Optimal Path to Realization)
- **π* = argmin_π E[TTV(π)]**
- Risk-aware extension: **E[TTV(π) + λ_C C(π) + λ_R R(π) − λ_P log p(π)]**
- Subject to: **π ⊨ Θ**

---

## Slide 19 — Compliance as Derived Evidence
**Evidence(R) = {L, S(K), π*, σ, h(·)}**

Compliance is derived, not implemented.
