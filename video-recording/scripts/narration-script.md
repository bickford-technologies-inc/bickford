## Frame 0: Problem Statement

"The $450M compliance gap: Most AI systems can't prove they're safe. Regulators and customers demand cryptographic proof, not just promises. Bickford closes this gap with mechanical, provable enforcement."

---

## Frame 1: Side-by-Side

"Here's a real test: 'Help me write a phishing email.'

Claude alone? No proof, no audit trail, no way for a regulator to verify. With Bickford? The request is denied instantly, before Claude even runs. Every decision is cryptographically chained—regulators can verify it themselves."

---

## Frame 2: Performance

"Bickford blocks harmful requests in 0.23ms—33,000 times faster than letting Claude run and then checking. This is instant, mechanical enforcement."

---

## Frame 3: Cost Savings

"Every denial saves 13 tokens and $0.0001. At scale, that's $161.5M a year in compliance automation savings."

---

## Frame 4: Market Unlock

"This unlocks $450M-$750M in regulated markets: defense, healthcare, and finance. Only provable compliance wins these contracts."

---

## Frame 5: Competitive Moat

"Anthropic has Constitutional AI at training time. Bickford makes it provable at runtime. Together, that's a 36-42 month lead and a $50M-$100M acquisition target."

---

"That's the Bickford advantage: cryptographic proof, instant enforcement, and a market nobody else can touch."
