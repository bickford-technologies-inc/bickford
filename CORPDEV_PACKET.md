# bickford — Decision Continuity Runtime
*(timestamp: 2025-12-20T14:07:00-05:00)*

## What is it

bickford is an execution runtime that preserves decision authority across time, teams, and agents by forcing all execution to flow through explicit, timestamped structure (Canon) governed by OPTR (Optimal Path to Reality - minimizing Time-to-Value).

## Why this matters to OpenAI

Autonomy at scale fails without decision continuity:
- **Drift**: Decisions lose context over time, leading to inconsistent behavior
- **Non-reproducible "learning"**: Systems claim improvement without verifiable evidence
- **Unsafe promotions to "structure"**: False patterns become embedded constraints
- **Multi-agent interference**: One agent's actions degrade another's optimal path (breaks execution equilibrium)

bickford's core control loop prevents these failure modes by design through:
1. Immutable decision tracking with cryptographic integrity (SHA-256 hash chains)
2. OPTR scoring for multi-criteria path evaluation (cost/time/risk/quality)
3. Governance gates with async validation rules and complete audit trails
4. Cross-device session continuity with checkpoint/restore capabilities
5. IP-protected integrations with automatic PII sanitization

## What you can verify right now (no trust required)

All releases include transaction-grade verification artifacts:

- **Build stamp:** `dist/build-stamp.json` - exact commit, version, build time
- **SBOM:** `dist/sbom.cdx.json` - complete software bill of materials
- **Evidence pack:** `dist/evidence-pack.json` - cryptographic hashes + integrity proofs

These prove:
- **Exact commit** (gitSha) - traceable to source
- **Exact version** - deterministic release identifier
- **Exact build time** - temporal proof of compilation
- **Integrity hashes** - tamper-evident verification for all key artifacts

## Core invariants (non-negotiable)

1. **Timestamps mandatory** for anything with execution authority
2. **No execution-impacting knowledge** unless promoted to Canon with provenance + timestamp
3. **Every action must cite** Canon/constraints/invariants (auditable authority chain)
4. **Promotion gate:** resistance ∧ reproducibility ∧ invariant safety ∧ feasibility impact (ΔΠ < 0)
5. **Multi-agent non-interference:** ΔE[TTV_j | π_i] ≤ 0 (execution equilibrium constraint)
6. **Trust-first auditable denial trace:** "Why Not?" is first-class, not an afterthought

## Technical highlights

- **Zero external dependencies** - No supply chain risk (Node.js crypto + fs only)
- **O(1) decision recording** - Constant-time immutable append
- **O(n) integrity verification** - Linear chain validation
- **O(m) path scoring** - Efficient multi-criteria evaluation
- **Frozen decision objects** - Immutable by construction
- **Cryptographic linking** - Blockchain-style integrity without blockchain overhead

## Architecture differentiators

**What makes this hard to replicate:**
1. **Integrated architecture** - All 5 components work together (most solutions are single-purpose)
2. **Cryptographic decision linking** - Blockchain-style integrity without operational complexity
3. **Cross-device session continuity** - Unique checkpoint/restore with device tracking
4. **Built-in IP protection** - Automatic PII sanitization + watermarking (not standard in decision systems)
5. **Math-first design** - Code is compiled from formal invariants, not vice versa
