# Bickford Neuropsych Pitch Deck Outline

---

## 1. Title Slide

- Bickford: The Executive Function for Constitutional AI
- Neuropsychological Compliance & Auditability

## 2. The Problem

- AI systems lack executive function (frontal lobe analogy)
- Regulated markets demand durable, auditable compliance
- Current AI = “Patient with frontal lobe syndrome”

## 3. Diagnosis: The Executive Function Gap

- Medical analogy: Frontal lobe damage → plausible but unreliable behavior
- AI analogy: No architectural guarantee of compliance or memory

## 4. The Bickford Solution

- Bickford = “Frontal lobe” for AI
- Cryptographic audit, canon enforcement, neuropsych assessment
- Every action logged, hashed, and externally auditable

## 5. How It Works (Brain/AI Mapping)

| Human Brain        | Bickford AI Platform       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Working Memory     | RAG + Ledger               |
| Episodic Memory    | Tamper-evident Ledger      |
| Semantic Memory    | Embedding Store            |
| Procedural Memory  | Canon Enforcement          |
| Executive Function | Canon + Audit + Assessment |

## 6. Demo: Before & After

- Before: AI fails neuropsych tests (context loss, canon violations)
- After: Bickford passes all tests, cryptographic proof
- [Insert visuals: error analysis, ledger screenshots]

## 7. Quantified ROI

- Unlocks $1B+ in regulated markets
- 500-6000% ROI (compliance cost savings, new revenue)
- Only Bickford offers cryptographic, neuropsych-style compliance

## 8. Competitive Comparison

| Feature               | Bickford | OpenAI | Anthropic | Others |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| Cryptographic Ledger  | ✅       | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     |
| Neuropsych Assessment | ✅       | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     |
| Canon Enforcement     | ✅       | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     |
| External Auditability | ✅       | ❌     | ❌        | ❌     |

## 9. Roadmap & Integration

- 6-8 week integration plan
- Live demo, compliance reports, customer pilots
- [Insert timeline graphic]

## 10. The Ask

- Integrate Bickford as executive function for Anthropic/Constitutional AI
- Leverage for regulated market entry
