**Timestamp:** 2025-12-20T20:15:00-05:00  
**Owner:** Derek Bickford  
**Purpose:** Acquisition / strategic diligence package (corp dev + legal + product + safety)

## Start Here

1. **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** - Complete index of all data room materials
2. **[ONE_PAGER.md](ONE_PAGER.md)** - Executive summary and acquisition thesis
3. **[CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MAP.md](CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MAP.md)** - Claims with evidence traceability
4. **[DEMO/DEMO_SCRIPT.md](DEMO/DEMO_SCRIPT.md)** - Live demonstration guide
5. **[TECH/ARCHITECTURE.md](TECH/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture deep dive
6. **[LEGAL/](LEGAL/)** and **[SECURITY/](SECURITY/)** - Risk and compliance documentation

## What This Is

This data room provides a **transaction-ready structure** designed to:
- Reduce diligence friction for corporate development teams
- Enable fast "go/no-go" decisions
- Provide evidence-backed claims
- Show (not just tell) product capabilities
- Address legal, security, and technical due diligence upfront

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a full codebase export** - See the main repository for source code
- **Not sales collateral** - This is designed for serious technical and business diligence
- **Not marketing materials** - Claims are backed by evidence and reproducible demonstrations

## Canon

In case of any discrepancy, documents in these directories are authoritative:
- **[LEGAL/](LEGAL/)** - Legal agreements, IP, compliance
- **SECURITY/](SECURITY/)** - Security posture, vulnerability reports, audit results
- **[TECH/](TECH/)** - Technical specifications, architecture, integration plans

All other documents support but do not override these core areas.
