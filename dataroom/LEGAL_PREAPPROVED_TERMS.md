# Legal Pre-Approved Terms — Deal Lubricants

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-20T20:26:00-05:00  
**Purpose:** Terms to accept upfront to accelerate Legal approval  
**Strategy:** Pre-acceptance removes negotiation friction

---

## Critical Meta-Point

These are **not concessions** — they are **deal lubricants**.

By accepting OpenAI-standard terms upfront, you:
1. Remove Legal objections before they form
2. Signal maturity and deal experience
3. Accelerate timeline by weeks
4. Make Legal your ally (not obstacle)

---

## Part 1: Transaction Structure (ACCEPT THESE)

### ✅ Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) Preferred

**OpenAI Position:**
* Prefer asset purchase over stock purchase
* Avoids legacy liabilities
* Cleaner integration
* Standard for acquisitions <$50M

**Your Response:**
> "Asset purchase is fine. We understand this is OpenAI standard."

**Why pre-accept:**
* Stock purchase is not worth fighting for
* Asset purchase is actually better for founder (no retained liabilities)
* This is non-negotiable at OpenAI anyway

---

### ✅ Buyer Selects Assets Explicitly

**OpenAI Position:**
* APA will list specific assets acquired
* Excludes anything not explicitly listed

**Your Response:**
> "We'll provide complete asset schedule. Buyer controls final list."

**Why pre-accept:**
* You want them to be explicit anyway (avoids later disputes)
* Asset schedule becomes your IP inventory document
* Shows transparency

---

### ✅ No Legacy Liability Assumption

**OpenAI Position:**
* Buyer assumes only explicitly stated liabilities
* Seller retains all others

**Your Response:**
> "Standard. Seller retains legacy liabilities."

**Why pre-accept:**
* Protects OpenAI (which they require anyway)
* Actually protects you too (limits post-close claims)
* Non-negotiable term

---

## Part 2: Representations & Warranties (ACCEPT THESE)

### ✅ Knowledge-Qualified Where Possible

**OpenAI Position:**
* Reps qualified with "to Seller's knowledge"
* Reduces absolute warranty exposure

**Your Response:**
> "Knowledge qualifiers are reasonable. We'll identify which reps need them."

**Why pre-accept:**
* This is seller-friendly (reduces your risk)
* OpenAI expects this anyway
* No reason to resist

**Example:**
* ❌ "No IP infringement exists"
* ✅ "To Seller's knowledge, no IP infringement exists"

---

### ✅ No Forward-Looking Performance Reps

**OpenAI Position:**
* No warranties about future adoption, performance, or success

**Your Response:**
> "Agreed. Reps are limited to current state and historical facts."

**Why pre-accept:**
* You cannot guarantee future outcomes anyway
* Protects you from impossible obligations
* OpenAI will not accept forward-looking reps regardless

**What you WON'T warrant:**
* "This will integrate successfully"
* "Enterprise customers will adopt this"
* "Performance will scale to X"

**What you WILL warrant:**
* "Current system is operational"
* "IP is owned as claimed"
* "No known defects in current implementation"

---

### ✅ No Success or Adoption Guarantees

**OpenAI Position:**
* System is purchased "as-is"
* No warranty of commercial success

**Your Response:**
> "Understood. This is not a performance guarantee."

**Why pre-accept:**
* OpenAI is buying potential, not guaranteed outcomes
* Protects you from subjective disputes
* Standard for technology acquisitions

---

## Part 3: Indemnification (ACCEPT THESE)

### ✅ Cap at Purchase Price

**OpenAI Position:**
* Seller indemnification capped at total consideration paid

**Your Response:**
> "Standard. Indemnification capped at purchase price."

**Why pre-accept:**
* This is seller-protective (limits your exposure)
* Universal standard in M&A
* OpenAI will not agree to unlimited indemnification anyway

**Example:**
* Purchase price: $10M
* Maximum liability: $10M (not $50M, not unlimited)

---

### ✅ Survival: 12–18 Months

**OpenAI Position:**
* Reps survive 12-18 months post-close
* After survival period, no claims allowed (except fraud)

**Your Response:**
> "12-18 month survival is acceptable."

**Why pre-accept:**
* Short survival is seller-friendly
* You want finite exposure window
* 12-18 months is industry standard for tech M&A

**Typical Survival Periods:**
* General reps: 12 months
* IP reps: 18 months (longer due to tail risk)
* Tax reps: statute of limitations (3-4 years, but irrelevant for asset purchase)
* Fraud: Unlimited (but requires intentional misrepresentation)

---

### ✅ No Special IP Indemnity

**OpenAI Position:**
* IP indemnity limited to ownership warranty
* No indemnity for future infringement claims

**Your Response:**
> "IP indemnity covers ownership representation only. No indemnity for future infringement."

**Why pre-accept:**
* You cannot control future patent troll claims
* Buyer assumes future IP risk (standard in tech M&A)
* This is actually protective of you

**What you WILL indemnify:**
* "I own the IP I'm selling"

**What you WON'T indemnify:**
* "No one will ever claim infringement in the future"

---

## Part 4: Founder Obligations (ACCEPT THESE)

### ✅ No Mandatory Long-Term Employment

**OpenAI Position:**
* Prefers no employment obligation
* Avoids HR complexity and comp committee approval

**Your Response:**
> "No employment required. Optional consulting only."

**Why pre-accept:**
* Employment creates tax complications
* You want flexibility anyway
* Consulting is simpler for both parties

---

### ✅ Consulting Optional, Capped (3-6 Months)

**OpenAI Position:**
* If consulting is included, it should be:
  * Optional (either party can terminate)
  * Time-limited (3-6 months maximum)
  * Scoped (knowledge transfer, not feature development)

**Your Response:**
> "Consulting capped at 6 months, scoped to integration support only."

**Why pre-accept:**
* You don't want to be operationally locked in
* OpenAI doesn't want dependency
* Short consulting period increases acquisition likelihood

---

### ✅ No Non-Compete Beyond Standard IP Protection

**OpenAI Position:**
* Non-compete limited to directly competing products
* Duration: 12-24 months maximum
* Scope: Execution authority/decision continuity only

**Your Response:**
> "Reasonable non-compete is acceptable: 12 months, scoped to direct competition."

**Why pre-accept:**
* You're not starting a competing company immediately anyway
* Shows good faith
* OpenAI needs this for deal justification

**What's reasonable:**
* ✅ "Won't build competing execution authority system for 12 months"
* ❌ "Won't work in AI/agents for 3 years"

---

## Part 5: Equity Participation (ACCEPT THESE)

### ✅ Synthetic / Phantom Equity Acceptable

**OpenAI Position:**
* No actual equity grants to founders (creates precedent)
* Synthetic equity or cash-settled participation OK

**Your Response:**
> "Synthetic equity or cash-settled participation works. No cap-table impact needed."

**Why pre-accept:**
* Achieves same economic outcome
* Removes comp committee / board friction
* OpenAI precedent is against founder equity grants

**Structure Options (all acceptable):**
1. **Cash earnout** tied to milestones
2. **Synthetic equity** (cash-settled based on OpenAI valuation)
3. **Profit interest** (cash-settled based on product performance)

---

### ✅ Cash-Settled Only

**OpenAI Position:**
* No actual ownership or governance rights
* Economic participation only

**Your Response:**
> "Cash-settled is fine. No governance or control rights expected."

**Why pre-accept:**
* You're not joining OpenAI long-term anyway
* Economic alignment is sufficient
* Removes HR/comp complexity

---

### ✅ No Governance or Control Rights

**OpenAI Position:**
* Founder has no say in product roadmap, resourcing, or strategy post-close

**Your Response:**
> "Understood. Full control transfers to OpenAI at close."

**Why pre-accept:**
* This is fundamental to acquisition
* Trying to retain control kills deals
* Advisory role (non-binding) can be negotiated separately

---

## Part 6: Deal Killers to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T Insist On:

1. **Stock purchase instead of asset purchase**
   * OpenAI will reject this immediately
   * Not worth the fight

2. **Unlimited indemnification**
   * No buyer will accept this
   * Absurd request signals inexperience

3. **Long-term employment guarantee**
   * Creates HR complexity
   * Slows deal approval
   * You don't want this anyway

4. **Actual equity (not synthetic)**
   * OpenAI precedent is against this
   * Triggers comp committee
   * Non-starter

5. **Subjective earnout metrics**
   * "Successful integration" is subjective
   * Creates post-close disputes
   * Legal will reject

6. **Revenue-based earnouts**
   * OpenAI doesn't sell this as standalone product
   * No way to measure
   * Dead end

## Part 7: Pre-Approval Script for Legal Call

### When Legal Asks About Structure

**Legal:**
> "Are you flexible on transaction structure?"

**You:**
> "Very. Asset purchase is fine. We understand that's OpenAI standard."

---

### When Legal Asks About Reps

**Legal:**
> "What warranties are you comfortable providing?"

**You:**
> "Standard tech M&A reps: ownership, no known infringement, no undisclosed issues. Knowledge-qualified where appropriate. No forward-looking performance warranties."

---

### When Legal Asks About Indemnification

**Legal:**
> "What indemnification terms are acceptable?"

**You:**
> "Cap at purchase price, 12-18 month survival for general reps, standard IP ownership indemnity only."

---

### When Legal Asks About Employment

**Legal:**
> "Do you expect an employment agreement?"

**You:**
> "No. Optional short-term consulting if helpful for integration, but no employment requirement."

---

## Part 8: What You SHOULD Negotiate

While pre-accepting standard terms, you should still negotiate:

### ✅ DO Negotiate:

1. **Purchase price** (within reason)
   * $8M-$10M is target range
   * Cash vs synthetic equity split

2. **Earnout metrics** (if included)
   * Ensure milestones are objective and achievable
   * Avoid subjective criteria

3. **Consulting scope and rate** (if included)
   * Hourly rate or monthly retainer
   * Hours per week cap
   * Specific deliverables

4. **Timeline** (gently)
   * "Happy to move at whatever pace works for you"
   * Not "we need to close by X date"

---

## Summary: Pre-Acceptance Strategy

### Why This Works

**For Legal:**
* You've removed 90% of standard negotiation points
* Deal structure is clean and standard
* Risk is bounded and familiar

**For Corp Dev:**
* Negotiations will be fast
* Founder is experienced and reasonable
* Deal won't die in Legal review

**For You:**
* Faster close (weeks saved)
* Better relationship with Legal
* Focus negotiations on price, not terms
