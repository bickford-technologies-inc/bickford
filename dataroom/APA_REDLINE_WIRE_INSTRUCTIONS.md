# APA Redline Round 1 — Simulation & Wire Instructions

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-20T21:02:00-05:00  
**Phase:** Post-term sheet, APA negotiation  
**Purpose:** Realistic redline simulation and closing mechanics

---

## Part 1: APA Redline — Round 1 (Simulated)

**Context:** Corp Dev + Legal send first APA draft  
**Your Goal:** Fast convergence, not leverage extraction  
**Timeline:** Review within 48 hours, respond with redlines

---

### 🔴 Redline #1 — Transaction Structure

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, and convey to Buyer all assets, including all right, title, and interest in and to the Purchased Assets as defined in Schedule A."

**Your Response:**
> ✅ **Accepted as drafted. No changes.**

**Rationale:**
* Asset clarity speeds everything
* Schedule A will list specific assets
* No ambiguity to fight

**Legal Review:** None needed (standard language)

---

### 🔴 Redline #2 — Representations & Warranties (IP Ownership)

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Seller represents and warrants that the Purchased Assets do not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights of any third party."

**Your Redline:**
> "Seller represents and warrants, **to Seller's knowledge**, that the Purchased Assets do not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights of any third party."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Standard knowledge qualifier for founder-built assets. Seller cannot warrant against unknown third-party claims."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Accepted (standard M&A practice)

---

### 🔴 Redline #3 — Indemnification Cap

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Seller's aggregate liability for indemnification claims shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase Price."

**Your Redline:**
> "Seller's aggregate liability for indemnification claims shall not exceed **one hundred percent (100%)** of the Purchase Price."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Cap at purchase price is standard. Protects both parties from disproportionate exposure."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Accepted (reasonable and standard)

**Why this works:**
* Still capped (not unlimited)
* Signals confidence in IP cleanliness
* Standard in tech M&A

---

### 🔴 Redline #4 — Survival Period

**Buyer Draft:**
> "All representations and warranties shall survive for twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date."

**Your Redline:**
> "General representations and warranties shall survive for **twelve (12) months** following the Closing Date. IP-related representations shall survive for **eighteen (18) months** following the Closing Date."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Tiered survival is standard: shorter for general reps, longer for IP due to patent claim tail risk."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Accepted (industry standard)

**Breakdown:**
* **General reps (12 months):** authority, no conflicts, no litigation
* **IP reps (18 months):** ownership, non-infringement, no encumbrances
* **Fraud (unlimited):** intentional misrepresentation (non-negotiable, stays unlimited)

---

### 🔴 Redline #5 — Founder Consulting

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Seller shall provide consulting services as reasonably requested by Buyer for a period of twelve (12) months following Closing, at no additional cost."

**Your Redline:**
> "Consulting services, if requested by Buyer, shall be **optional**, **time-bound to six (6) months maximum**, and subject to a **separate consulting agreement** with **mutually agreed compensation**."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "System is operational and documented. Optional consulting removes dependency and allows both parties flexibility."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Likely accepted (removes their dependency risk too)

**Why this works:**
* "Optional" = no forced obligation
* "6 months max" = finite exposure
* "Separate agreement" = clear scope and terms
* "Mutually agreed compensation" = removes implicit free labor

---

### 🔴 Redline #6 — Publicity & Announcements

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Buyer may issue press releases and public announcements regarding the transaction at its sole discretion."

**Your Redline:**
> "Buyer controls publicity and public announcements. Use of Seller's name in external communications requires **Seller's prior written consent**, not to be unreasonably withheld."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Standard protection for founder privacy. Buyer controls timing and content, but founder approves name usage."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Usually accepted or modified to "Buyer controls, name usage in good faith"

**Why this works:**
* Buyer still controls announcement timing
* You prevent unwanted publicity
* "Not to be unreasonably withheld" shows flexibility

---

### 🔴 Redline #7 — Basket / Deductible for Indemnification

**Buyer Draft:**
> "No indemnification claims shall be payable unless aggregate claims exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000)."

**Your Redline:**
> "No indemnification claims shall be payable unless aggregate claims exceed **Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000)** (the 'Basket')."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Higher basket reduces nuisance claims. $25K-$50K is standard for transactions of this size."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Likely accepted at $25K-$50K

**Why this works:**
* Reduces legal costs for both parties
* Standard practice ($10K is low for $25M transaction)
* Shows confidence in asset quality

---

### 🔴 Redline #8 — Excluded Liabilities

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Buyer assumes no liabilities of Seller except as expressly set forth in this Agreement."

**Your Response:**
> ✅ **Accepted as drafted. No changes.**

**Rationale:**
* Standard for asset purchase
* Protects both parties
* Already favorable to you

---

### 🔴 Redline #9 — Representations (No Forward-Looking Statements)

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Seller represents that the Purchased Assets will integrate successfully with Buyer's systems and will be adopted by enterprise customers."

**Your Redline:**
> **DELETE ENTIRELY.** Replace with: "Seller makes no representations regarding future performance, adoption, integration, or commercial success of the Purchased Assets. Purchased Assets are provided 'as-is' with respect to future outcomes."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Forward-looking warranties are unacceptable and non-standard in tech M&A. Seller can only warrant current state and historical facts."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Accepted (Buyer likely included by mistake or for negotiation)

**Why this is critical:**
* You cannot guarantee future adoption
* Integration depends on Buyer's execution
* "As-is" for future outcomes is standard

---

### 🔴 Redline #10 — Definitions (Purchased Assets)

**Buyer Draft:**
> "Purchased Assets means all assets of Seller."

**Your Redline:**
> "Purchased Assets means those assets specifically listed in **Schedule A**, including but not limited to: software source code, documentation, trademarks, domain names, and goodwill associated with the bickford business."

**Rationale (if asked):**
> "Specific asset list prevents ambiguity. Schedule A provides clarity for both parties."

**Expected Outcome:** ✅ Accepted (precise drafting benefits both parties)

---

## ✅ Result of Redline Round 1

**Summary:**
* 10 redlines submitted
* 3 accepted as-is (transaction structure, excluded liabilities, asset clarity)
* 7 modified (IP knowledge qualifier, indemnification, survival, consulting, publicity, basket, no forward-looking)
* 0 fundamental disagreements

**Legal sees you as:**
* Experienced (knowledge of standard terms)
* Reasonable (accepting buyer-protective language where appropriate)

**Next Step:**
