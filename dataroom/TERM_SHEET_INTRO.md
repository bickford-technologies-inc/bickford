# Term Sheet — Transaction Overview (Execution Authority Framing)

**timestamp:** 2025-12-20T21:18:00-05:00 (America/New_York)  
**purpose:** Reframed transaction overview emphasizing execution authority primitive positioning  
**audience:** Corp Dev, Legal, Exec Sponsor

## Recommended Term Sheet Introduction

### Transaction Overview

Buyer proposes to acquire the assets comprising **bickford**, a **model-agnostic execution authority runtime** that deterministically governs when and how AI intent is permitted to execute in the real world. bickford sits above agent execution to enforce action gating, decision continuity, promotion invariants, and multi-agent non-interference. The acquisition is intended to establish a canonical execution control primitive—separable from models and evaluations—that converts OpenAI's knowledge and policies into **enforceable runtime authority**.

---

## Why This Framing Works

### 1. **Names the Layer**
"Execution authority runtime" clearly identifies where bickford sits in the stack—not in models, not in evals, but in the enforcement layer between reasoning and action.

### 2. **Declares Separability**
"Model-agnostic" and "separable from models and evaluations" preemptively addresses overlap concerns. This is a distinct primitive, not competing with OpenAI's core strengths.

### 3. **Frames Ownership as Defining Reality**
"Converts knowledge and policies into enforceable runtime authority" positions the acquisition as establishing who controls execution semantics—a foundational decision, not a feature addition.

### 4. **Avoids Scope Inflation**
No mention of "complete agent platform" or "comprehensive governance." Narrow scope = narrow resistance.

### 5. **Technical Without Being Threatening**
Uses precise language ("action gating," "promotion invariants," "non-interference") that signals sophistication without triggering "this is too big" anxiety.

## Alternative Framings (If Requested)

### More Technical Version
> Buyer proposes to acquire bickford, a deterministic execution authority layer that enforces admissibility constraints, decision persistence, and multi-agent coordination at the boundary between agent reasoning and real-world action. The system provides cryptographically verifiable audit trails, promotion gates for structural learning, and enforceable non-interference guarantees across concurrent agent operations.

**When to use:** If technical reviewers want more precision about mechanisms.

---

### More Executive Version
> Buyer proposes to acquire bickford, the execution control system that ensures OpenAI's AI agents can only take actions that are provably safe, auditable, and authorized. This acquisition establishes OpenAI's ownership of the critical layer between agent intent and real-world execution.

**When to use:** If briefing board or non-technical executives.

## What NOT to Say

### ❌ Avoid These Phrases

1. **"Comprehensive governance platform"** - Too broad, triggers scope concerns
2. **"Agent orchestration system"** - Sounds like infrastructure overlap
3. **"Next-generation safety framework"** - Implies existing safety is inadequate
4. **"Complete agent lifecycle management"** - Overreaches into multiple domains
5. **"Revolutionary execution paradigm"** - Hype triggers skepticism

### ✅ Use These Instead

1. **"Execution authority primitive"** - Narrow, foundational
2. **"Action gating layer"** - Specific, non-threatening
3. **"Runtime enforcement"** - Technical, clear boundary
4. **"Deterministic control"** - Precise capability claim
5. **"Canonical authority"** - Ownership claim without overreach

---

## Usage Instructions

### For Term Sheet
Place this paragraph at the top of the term sheet, immediately after "TERM SHEET" heading and before "Parties."

### For Board Memo
Use the "More Executive Version" in board materials where technical detail is less important than strategic positioning.

### For Technical Diligence
Reference the "More Technical Version" when Safety or Agents teams request detailed capability descriptions.

## Positioning Rationale

This framing accomplishes three strategic goals simultaneously:

1. **Elevates the asset** from "governance tool" to "control primitive"
2. **Narrows perceived scope** to reduce integration anxiety
3. **Preserves pricing power** by framing as infrastructure, not feature

The language is deliberately chosen to make this feel **inevitable** rather than **optional**.

---

## Next Steps After Acceptance

Once this framing is accepted in term sheet discussions:

1. **Reinforce consistently** - Use "execution authority" language in all subsequent materials
2. **Don't expand scope** - Resist temptation to add features or capabilities
3. **Let them discover value** - Allow OpenAI teams to identify additional use cases organically
4. **Maintain narrow focus** - The simpler the primitive, the harder to replace

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

If OpenAI pushes back with these objections, respond as follows:

### Objection: "This seems like it should be part of the agent platform"
**Response:** "Execution authority is infrastructure—it sits below the platform, not in it. Like authentication or rate limiting, it's a shared primitive."

### Objection: "Why isn't this just policy enforcement?"
**Response:** "Policies describe intent; this enforces admissibility at runtime. Different layer, different function."

### Objection: "This overlaps with safety systems"
**Response:** "Safety assesses; this enforces. Safety produces judgments; this converts judgments into gates."

## Final Note

This framing has been tightened based on the shift from "governance tooling" to "execution authority primitive." The language is designed to reduce resistance while elevating strategic importance—a critical balance for deals at this scale.

**Use exactly as written** in initial term sheet discussions. Adjust only if OpenAI explicitly requests different framing.
