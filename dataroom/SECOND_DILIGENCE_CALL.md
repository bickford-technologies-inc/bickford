**Phase:** Post-initial alignment, pre-term sheet  
**Purpose:** Remove remaining friction and decide process to close

---

## Context

* Internal sponsor secured ✅
* Build vs Buy memo circulated ✅
* Corp Dev believes this is directionally right ✅
* **Goal:** Remove remaining friction and decide **process to close**

---

## Participants

* **You** (Founder)

---

## Call Structure

### Opening (Corp Dev)

**Corp Dev:**
> "We're aligned that this is interesting. We want to pressure-test integration, risk, and structure."

**Correct response:**
> "Happy to. I'll keep answers tight."

**Why this works:**
* Signals maturity
* Acknowledges their process
* Sets expectation for brevity

---

### Question 1: Organizational Fit

**Safety / Agents:**
> "Where would this live organizationally?"

**You:**
> "Above agents, not inside them. Think execution governance shared across Safety and Platform."

**DO NOT:**
* Suggest specific teams unless asked
* Propose org changes
* Imply you know their structure better than they do

**Why this works:**
* Neutral positioning
* Doesn't create turf battles
* Lets them solve org placement

---

### Question 2: Post-Close Obligations

**Legal:**
> "What commitments are required post-close?"

**You:**
> "None operationally. Optional short-term consulting if helpful, scoped and time-bound."

**Key phrase:** "None operationally"

**Why this works:**
* Removes retention leverage
* Signals system is complete
* Makes deal simpler (Legal loves simple)

---

### Question 3: Structure Flexibility

**Corp Dev:**
> "What's your flexibility on structure?"

**You:**
> "High. Cash primary, synthetic equity for alignment if useful. I care about speed and clarity."

**Key words:** "speed and clarity"

**Why this works:**
* Signals you're not optimizing for maximum dollars
* Makes Corp Dev's job easier
* Avoids complex earnouts

---

### Question 4: Asset vs Stock Purchase

**Corp Dev:**
> "Any objections to asset purchase vs stock?"

**You:**
> "Asset purchase is fine."

**DO NOT:**
* Ask why they prefer asset purchase
* Negotiate tax treatment on the call
* Introduce complexity

**Why this is critical:**
* Asset purchase is OpenAI standard for small acquisitions
* Avoids legacy liability assumption
* Accepting immediately removes negotiation friction

---

### Question 5: Integration Timeline

**Safety / Agents:**
> "How quickly can this be integrated?"

**You:**
> "3-month pilot, 6-month production rollout. Integration is at the tool boundary, not core infra."

**Why this works:**
* Realistic timeline
* Scoped integration point
* Doesn't require deep platform changes

---

### Question 6: Competitive Dynamics

**Corp Dev:**
> "Are you in conversations with others?"

**You:**
> "Yes, but OpenAI is preferred for strategic fit."

**DO NOT:**
* Name specific competitors
* Create false urgency
* Imply bidding war

**Why this works:**
* Honest without revealing details
* Flatters OpenAI (they like to be preferred)
* Doesn't feel like pressure tactic

---

### Question 7: Deal Breakers

**Legal:**
> "What are your non-negotiables?"

**You:**
> "IP ownership transfer, reasonable liability cap, no open-ended retention. Everything else is flexible."

**Why this works:**
* Shows you've thought it through
* Reasonable requests
* Signals maturity

---

**Corp Dev:**
> "Okay. We'll propose next steps."

**Correct action:**

* Provide evidence
* Remove friction

---

   * Don't negotiate aggressively

2. **New information**
   * Don't introduce new claims
   * Don't expand scope

## Likely Questions You'll Face (Extended List)

### Technical Integration

**Q:** "Does this require changes to our model serving infrastructure?"  
**A:** "No. It sits at the tool boundary, above model execution."

**Q:** "What's the performance overhead?"  
**A:** "Sub-5ms for decision authorization. Negligible for typical agent workflows."

**Q:** "How does this handle multi-region deployments?"  
**A:** "Current architecture is single-region. Multi-region is 6-month enhancement."

### Commercial / Competitive

**Q:** "What if AWS builds this?"  
**A:** "Then OpenAI agents become guests on AWS infrastructure. This prevents that."

**Q:** "Why haven't other agent frameworks built this?"  
**A:** "They're focused on capabilities. Governance layers lag behind by 12-18 months."

**Q:** "Is this patented?"  
**A:** "Patent applications in progress for core innovations. Details in IP inventory."

### Risk / Downside

**Q:** "What's the worst-case integration outcome?"  
**A:** "We own clean governance infrastructure we don't deploy broadly. Low regret."

**Q:** "What if adoption is slow?"  
**A:** "System is operational today. No adoption dependency for core value."

**Q:** "How do we know this won't need constant updates?"  
**A:** "Governance semantics are stable. Extensions are additive, not breaking."
