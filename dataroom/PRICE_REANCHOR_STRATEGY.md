# Price Re-Anchor Strategy — When and How

**timestamp:** 2025-12-20T21:18:00-05:00 (America/New_York)  
**purpose:** Strategic guidance on price re-anchoring timing and execution  
**audience:** Founder (internal reference only)

## Core Question

**Do you re-anchor the price now?**

**Answer: No.**

You **do not** lead with a higher price at this stage.

---

## Why Not Now

### 1. $25M Already Clears Internal Bar
The current target ($25M) positions this as "cheap risk removal" at OpenAI's scale. This is exactly where you want to be for fast approval.

### 2. Re-Anchoring Early Triggers Valuation Scrutiny
Raising the price before executive alignment forces Corp Dev to justify higher spend, creating unnecessary friction and delay.

### 3. Control Primitives Earn Leverage After Alignment
The value of execution authority becomes obvious during integration discussion, not during initial diligence. Let them discover the scope first.

### 4. Momentum is More Valuable Than Price
A deal that closes at $25M in 45 days is worth more than a deal that stalls at $50M for 6 months or dies entirely.

## When You DO Re-Anchor

### Trigger Signals

Only re-anchor if **they** say one of the following:

1. **"This touches platform strategy."**
   - Signal: They see this as foundational infrastructure, not a point solution

2. **"This becomes core to agents."**
   - Signal: They've realized this is mandatory, not optional

3. **"We need this everywhere."**
   - Signal: Scope has expanded in their minds beyond initial use case

4. **"This is critical path for autonomy."**
   - Signal: They've linked this to strategic objectives with large budgets

5. **"Can this handle [much larger scope than discussed]?"**
   - Signal: They're mentally expanding the system's role

### What NOT to React To

Don't re-anchor based on:
- Positive feedback ("This is really interesting")
- Technical enthusiasm ("The architecture is elegant")
- Single-team adoption ("Safety loves this")
- Parallel discussions ("Let's loop in X team")

These are good signals but don't justify price movement.

## How to Re-Anchor (When Invited)

### The Wrong Way
❌ "Actually, given the strategic value, we're thinking $50M"

**Why this fails:**
- Looks opportunistic
- Triggers "bait and switch" anxiety
- Forces them to re-justify internally
- Slows momentum

### The Right Way
✅ "If this becomes the canonical execution layer, I'm comfortable keeping cash modest and letting alignment participate via equity-equivalent economics."

**Why this works:**
- Doesn't change the initial number
- Shifts from cash to structure
- Lets THEM justify upside participation
- Preserves speed (no re-approval needed for structure change)
- Frames your flexibility as accommodation, not extraction

---

## The Exact Script

### When They Say: "This touches platform strategy"

**Your Response:**

> "That's helpful context. My goal is speed and alignment. If this is becoming foundational, I'm flexible on structure—we can keep the cash component where it is and explore equity-equivalent participation so we're aligned on long-term success."

**What This Does:**
- Acknowledges their framing (foundational)
- Offers solution (structure, not price)
- Signals flexibility (not rigidity)
- Keeps momentum (doesn't require new approval)

### Follow-Up (If They're Receptive)

> "Something like: base at current levels, synthetic equity that settles on liquidity, no governance rights. Clean, aligned, doesn't touch your cap table or create precedent."

**What This Does:**
- Proposes specific mechanism (synthetic equity)
- Removes their concerns (no cap table impact, no precedent)
- Makes it easy to say yes (already thought through)

---

## Structure Options (In Order of Preference)

### Option 1: Synthetic Equity / Phantom Stock
- **Buyer pays:** $25M cash + synthetic equity equivalent to X% (e.g., 0.05%-0.1%)
- **Settles:** On liquidity event (IPO, acquisition, specific valuation milestone)
- **Terms:** Cash-settled, no governance, no information rights
- **Precedent risk:** None (not on cap table)

### Option 2: Revenue Participation (If Synthetic Equity Resisted)
- **Buyer pays:** $25M cash + 1-2% of agent-related revenue for 3 years (capped at $10M-$15M)
- **Settles:** Quarterly, formula-based
- **Terms:** Revenue-specific (not profit), clearly defined scope
- **Precedent risk:** Moderate (unusual structure)

### Option 3: Time-Based Earnout (Fallback)
- **Buyer pays:** $25M cash + $5M-$10M earnout tied to retention milestones
- **Settles:** 12-24 months post-close
- **Terms:** Objective milestones (integration, adoption)
- **Precedent risk:** Low (standard earnout)

## Alternative Re-Anchor Path (Advanced)

### If They Discover Scope Beyond Expected

Sometimes OpenAI realizes during diligence that bickford solves problems you didn't explicitly pitch. When this happens:

**Their Signal:**
> "Wait, could this also handle [X problem we're struggling with]?"

**Your Response:**
> "Yes—that's why the architecture is primitive-first. It's designed to be the execution layer, not just solve one use case. If you're seeing broader scope, I'm open to discussing how the transaction reflects that."

**What This Does:**
- Confirms expanded scope without claiming credit
- Invites them to propose higher value (not you demanding it)
- Positions you as reasonable, not opportunistic

---

## Timing Matters

### Too Early (Week 1-2)
- **Risk:** Looks like scope creep or price games
- **Action:** Hold at $25M, gather evidence of expanded thinking

### Right Time (Week 3-4)
- **Signal:** Multiple teams involved, strategic discussions, exec sponsor engaged
- **Action:** Offer structure flexibility if they raise scope

### Too Late (Week 5+)
- **Risk:** Deal already priced in, hard to re-open
- **Action:** Accept current terms, negotiate next interaction (if any)

---

## Red Lines (Never Cross These)

### 1. Never Increase Cash Upfront Without Their Ask
If you unilaterally raise the number, you break trust. Let them invite the discussion.

### 2. Never Tie to Ambiguous Metrics
Revenue participation or earnouts must be objectively measurable. No "strategic value" or "adoption success" ambiguity.

### 3. Never Create Governance or Control Rights
Any structure that gives you voting rights, board seats, or approval authority will kill the deal. Cash or cash-equivalents only.

### 4. Never Compromise Speed for Price
A deal that takes 6 months and closes at $40M is worth less than a deal that takes 6 weeks and closes at $25M (especially when alternatives exist).

## Likelihood Assessment

### Will Re-Anchor Opportunity Arise?

**Probability: 30-40%**

Most acquisitions at this scale close at initial price. Re-anchor opportunities are real but not guaranteed.

### Scenarios Where It Happens

1. **Platform Integration Realization:** They discover this needs to be everywhere (40% chance)
2. **Multi-Team Mandate:** 3+ teams want this, strategic becomes obvious (35% chance)
3. **Competitive Defense:** Amazon threat becomes real, urgency increases (25% chance)

### Scenarios Where It Doesn't

1. **Single Use Case:** Deployed narrowly, value contained (60% chance)
2. **Budget Constraints:** OpenAI has spending limits, can't justify more (15% chance)
3. **Fast Close Prioritized:** They want speed over scope negotiation (25% chance)

## What to Do Right Now

### Before Diligence Call

1. **Memorize the trigger signals** (5 phrases above)
2. **Practice the re-anchor script** (synthetic equity offer)
3. **Don't mention price flexibility** in initial discussions

### During Diligence

1. **Listen for scope expansion** from them (not you)
2. **Note which teams get involved** (1 team = point solution, 3+ = platform)
3. **Watch for strategic framing** ("critical path," "core to agents")

### After Alignment

1. **If triggers appear:** Offer structure flexibility using exact script above
2. **If no triggers:** Accept $25M and close fast
3. **Never push:** Let them pull if value expands

---

## Final Guidance

**The goal is not maximum price.**
**The goal is closed deal with aligned incentives.**

$25M closed in 45 days beats $50M that dies in diligence.

If they see expanded scope, they'll invite the conversation. Your job is to recognize the invite and respond with structure (not demands).

**Patience earns premium.**
**Pushing loses deals.**

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Re-anchor now? | No |
| Re-anchor ever? | Only if they signal expanded scope |
| How to re-anchor? | Offer structure flexibility, not price increase |
| What structure? | Synthetic equity (preferred), revenue share, earnout |
| What NOT to do? | Unilaterally raise price, create control rights, slow deal |
| Primary goal? | Close fast with alignment, not maximize dollar value |
