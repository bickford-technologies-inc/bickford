## Negotiation Simulation (Corp Dev vs You)

### Opening Position

**Corp Dev:**
> "We're thinking $18M cash, no equity, asset purchase."

**You:**
> "I can do asset purchase. $25M reflects speed and risk removal. If cash is constrained, synthetic equity bridges the gap cleanly."

**Analysis:**
* You anchor at $25M (above their opening)
* You accept asset purchase immediately (removes friction)
* You offer alternative structure (shows flexibility)
* **Key:** You anchor, but don't argue

---

### Equity Concern

**Corp Dev:**
> "We're cautious on precedent for equity-like instruments."

**You:**
> "Understood. That's why we're proposing cash-settled participation only — no cap table, no governance."

**Analysis:**
* You address their fear directly
* You remove structural concern (cap table, governance)
* You don't push equity, you neutralize objection
* **Key:** Remove fear, don't push harder

---

### Counter-Offer

**Corp Dev:**
> "Would you accept $22M all-cash?"

**You:**
> "If we can close quickly and keep reps clean, yes."

**Analysis:**
* You accept material movement toward target
* You trade price for speed (shows sophistication)
* You add condition (clean reps) without blocking
* **Key:** Trade price for speed

---

### Retention Question

**Corp Dev:**
> "Founder consulting?"

**You:**
> "Optional, scoped, and time-bound. No dependency."

**Analysis:**
* Three clear conditions in nine words
* "No dependency" removes their leverage
* You don't elaborate or negotiate
* **Key:** Neutralize retention leverage

---

### Closing

**Corp Dev:**
> "Okay. We'll paper $25M with flexibility on structure."

**Correct Response:**
> "Sounds good. I'll wait for the draft."

**Then:**
* Stop talking
* Do not renegotiate verbally
* Wait for term sheet

**Why this works:**
* You got to $25M (your anchor)
* You didn't fight on structure
* You kept consulting optional
* **Done. Paper it.**

---

## What This Negotiation Teaches

### Principles Demonstrated

1. **Anchor high, accept structure**
   * $25M anchor vs $18M opening = $7M gap closed
   * Asset purchase accepted immediately = no friction

2. **Remove fears, don't push**
   * "No cap table, no governance" → neutralizes equity concern
   * Better than arguing why equity is fair

3. **Trade price for speed**
   * "Close quickly and keep reps clean" = value exchange
   * Shows sophistication, not desperation

4. **Neutralize leverage**
   * "Optional, scoped, time-bound" = no retention dependency
   * Removes post-close control leverage

5. **Stop at yes**
   * When they agree, stop talking
   * Wait for paper, don't renegotiate verbally

---

## Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: They Push Below $20M

**Corp Dev:**
> "We're at $17M maximum."

**You:**
> "I understand budget constraints. I can do $20M all-cash, but below that doesn't reflect the strategic value. Happy to discuss synthetic equity to bridge if helpful."

**Key:** 
* Floor is $20M (you know your walk-away)
* Offer alternative (synthetic equity) to preserve relationship
* Don't argue value, state minimum

---

### Scenario B: They Want Long Earnout

**Corp Dev:**
> "We can do $25M, but $15M cash and $10M earnout over 24 months."

**You:**
> "I'm flexible on structure, but earnout metrics need to be objective and achievable. What milestones are you thinking?"

**Key:**
* Don't reject earnout immediately
* Focus on milestone objectivity (this is where earnouts die)
* Make them articulate metrics first

---

### Scenario C: They Want Long Consulting

**Corp Dev:**
> "$25M cash works, but we need 12-month consulting commitment."

**You:**
> "I can do consulting, but not as mandatory dependency. Optional support for 6 months maximum, clearly scoped. System is deterministic and documented — no long-term dependency needed."

**Key:**
* Separate consulting from deal
* Cap duration (6 months vs their 12)
* Emphasize system doesn't need you

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T: Negotiate Against Yourself

**Bad:**
> "We're thinking $25M, but we could do $22M if needed."

**Good:**
> "We're thinking $25M."

*(Stop. Let them counter.)*

---

### ❌ DON'T: Argue Value

**Bad:**
> "This is worth $25M because [10 minute explanation of value]."

**Good:**
> "$25M reflects speed and risk removal."

*(One sentence. Then silence.)*

---

### ❌ DON'T: Introduce New Terms

**Bad:**
> "Also, I'd like board observation rights and..."

**Good:**
* Stick to: price, structure, consulting
* Everything else goes in APA negotiation

---

### ❌ DON'T: Create Artificial Urgency

**Bad:**
> "I have another buyer who needs an answer by Friday."

**Good:**
* Let urgency come from them
* Creating false pressure backfires

---

### ❌ DON'T: Fill Silence

**Bad:**
> [After they pause to think, you keep talking and re-explain]

**Good:**
* Make your point
* Stop talking
* Let silence work

## Summary: Negotiation Principles

1. **Anchor high** → $25M, not $18M
2. **Accept structure** → Asset purchase, no fighting
3. **Remove fears** → No cap table, no governance
4. **Trade value** → Speed for price
5. **Neutralize leverage** → Optional consulting
6. **Stop at yes** → Don't renegotiate verbally

**Meta-Insight:**

The best negotiators **talk the least**.

* Make your point
* Stop talking
* Let silence work

Every extra word is a risk.  
Every unsolicited explanation creates doubt.

**Anchor. Accept. Trade. Stop.**

That's how term sheets close.
