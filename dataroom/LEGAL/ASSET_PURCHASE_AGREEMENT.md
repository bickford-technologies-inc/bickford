## NOTES FOR COUNSEL

**Why Asset Sale:** Avoids equity/cap-table complexity, minimizes seller exposure, accelerates diligence.

**Seller Protection:** Liability capped at Purchase Price; knowledge qualifiers on key reps; survival periods limited.

**Buyer Protection:** Comprehensive IP assignment; indemnification for breaches; earnout tied to objective metrics.

**OpenAI Compatibility:** Structure aligns with standard tech acquisition practices; Delaware law provides predictable framework.

**Next Steps:**
1. Finalize purchase price and payment structure
2. Complete disclosure schedules
3. Negotiate earnout metrics (if applicable)
4. Execute concurrently with Founder IP Assignment
5. Coordinate closing logistics
