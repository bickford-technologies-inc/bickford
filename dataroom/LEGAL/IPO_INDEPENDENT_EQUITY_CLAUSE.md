## Section X — Economic Participation (IPO-Independent)

### X.1 Grant

At Closing, Buyer shall grant Seller an **economic participation right** equal to **[0.20%–0.35%]** of Buyer's **Fully-Diluted Equity Value** (the "Participation"), **vested in full at Closing**, **non-voting**, **non-governance**, and **non-transferable** except as expressly provided herein.

### X.2 Liquidity Events (Comprehensive Definition)

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Liquidity Event" means **any** of the following (whether public or private):

(a) **Initial public offering** of Buyer's equity securities on any recognized stock exchange;

(b) **Tender offer, secondary sale, or other company-approved liquidity program** that provides cash or cash-equivalent consideration to equity holders;

(c) **Merger, consolidation, sale of control, or change-of-control transaction** where (i) more than 50% of Buyer's voting securities are transferred, or (ii) control of Buyer's board is transferred;

(d) **Asset sale or reorganization** resulting in material distribution of value to equity holders (material defined as aggregate distributions exceeding 20% of Buyer's Fully-Diluted Equity Value);

(e) **Dividend or distribution** (whether cash or in-kind) to equity holders, excluding ordinary course dividends not exceeding $50 million in aggregate per fiscal year;

(f) **Any transaction or series of transactions** that provides **cash or cash-equivalent consideration** to equity holders representing in aggregate more than 10% of Buyer's Fully-Diluted Equity Value.

### X.3 Payment Mechanics

Upon a Liquidity Event, Buyer shall pay Seller **cash** equal to the Participation multiplied by the **gross value distributed** to equity holders in such Liquidity Event, calculated as follows:

**Payment Amount = Participation % × (Total Value Distributed - Transaction Expenses)**

where:
- **Total Value Distributed** = aggregate consideration (cash or cash-equivalent fair market value) distributed to all equity holders
- **Transaction Expenses** = customary transaction expenses (legal, banking, accounting fees) directly attributable to the Liquidity Event, not exceeding 3% of Total Value Distributed
- **Payment Timing** = within 10 business days following distribution to equity holders, or concurrently if administratively feasible

### X.4 Survival; No Forfeiture; Perpetual Duration

(a) The Participation **survives termination** of any consulting, advisory, or employment relationship between Seller and Buyer.

(b) The Participation **does not expire** and remains exercisable indefinitely until a Liquidity Event occurs or Seller receives payment in full.

(c) The Participation is **not subject to**:
   - Performance conditions or milestones
   - Continued service requirements
   - Earn-out provisions
   - Vesting schedules beyond the initial grant
   - Forfeiture provisions (except as provided in Section X.8)

(d) The Participation is **transferable only** by will, intestate succession, or court order. Any attempted transfer in violation of this provision is void.

### X.5 Parity; Anti-Dilution (Structural Protection)

(a) The Participation shall be calculated on a **fully-diluted basis**, including:
   - All outstanding common and preferred stock
   - All options, warrants, and convertible securities (on an as-converted basis)
   - All stock appreciation rights and phantom equity
   - All other equity-equivalent instruments

(b) The Participation shall be **automatically adjusted** for:
   - Stock splits, reverse splits, and stock combinations
   - Stock dividends and distributions
   - Recapitalizations, reorganizations, and reclassifications
   - Any transaction that changes the number or class of outstanding equity securities

(c) Adjustments shall preserve the **economic equivalence** of the Participation immediately before and after such event.

(d) Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller of any adjustment within 10 business days, including calculation methodology.

### X.6 Information Rights & Audit (Lightweight)

(a) **Notice Requirement:** Buyer shall provide Seller written notice of any proposed Liquidity Event at least 30 days prior to closing (or as soon as reasonably practicable).

(b) **Payment Statement:** Within 10 business days following a Liquidity Event, Buyer shall provide Seller a written statement showing:
   - Total Value Distributed
   - Transaction Expenses (with supporting documentation)
   - Participation percentage
   - Payment amount calculation
   - Payment date

(c) **Audit Right (Limited):** Seller may, upon 30 days' written notice and at Seller's expense, engage an independent third-party auditor to review Buyer's calculation of Payment Amount, limited to:
   - Once per Liquidity Event
   - During normal business hours
   - Subject to customary confidentiality restrictions
   - Scope limited to Payment Amount calculation accuracy

(d) **Adjustment:** If audit reveals Payment Amount error exceeding 5%, Buyer shall reimburse Seller's reasonable audit costs and pay any shortfall within 30 days.

(e) **No Ongoing Information Rights:** Except as expressly provided above, Seller has no right to receive financial statements, board materials, or other non-public information.

### X.7 Tax Treatment & Characterization

(a) **Intent:** The parties intend that the Participation be treated as a **contractual right to payment** (not equity or options) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

(b) **Section 409A Compliance:** The Participation is designed to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or qualify for an exemption therefrom. Buyer may make adjustments reasonably necessary to achieve compliance, provided such adjustments do not materially reduce Seller's economic benefit.

(c) **Withholding:** Buyer may withhold applicable taxes from any payment, and such withholding shall not reduce the gross Payment Amount owed to Seller (Buyer bears withholding cost).

(d) **Tax Reporting:** Buyer shall provide Seller with appropriate tax forms (e.g., Form 1099) as required by law.

### X.8 Forfeiture (Limited Circumstances Only)

The Participation shall be forfeited **only** if:

(a) Seller materially breaches the Asset Purchase Agreement representations and warranties, and such breach results in indemnification liability to Buyer exceeding $500,000; **and**

(b) Buyer provides written notice of breach and Seller fails to cure within 60 days (if curable); **and**

(c) Buyer obtains a final, non-appealable judgment or arbitration award confirming the breach and damages.

Upon forfeiture, Seller's Participation shall terminate without further payment.

### X.9 Assignment by Buyer; Change of Control

(a) **Buyer Assignment:** The obligations under this Section X shall be **binding on Buyer's successors and assigns**, including any entity resulting from a merger, consolidation, or reorganization.

(b) **Change of Control:** In the event of a change of control of Buyer that does not itself constitute a Liquidity Event (e.g., non-cash stock-for-stock merger), the surviving entity shall assume all obligations under this Section X, and the Participation shall be adjusted to maintain economic equivalence.

(c) **Acceleration on Buyer Bankruptcy:** If Buyer (or its successor) files for bankruptcy, the Participation shall accelerate and become immediately payable based on Buyer's Fully-Diluted Equity Value as of the bankruptcy filing date (as reasonably determined by an independent valuation).

### X.10 Dispute Resolution

(a) **Disputes** regarding calculation of Payment Amount, Fully-Diluted Equity Value, or interpretation of this Section X shall be resolved by **binding arbitration** under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

(b) **Arbitrator Qualifications:** Single arbitrator with expertise in corporate finance and M&A transactions.

(c) **Location:** Arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California (or other mutually agreed location).

(d) **Costs:** Each party bears its own costs; arbitrator's fees split equally.

(e) **Judgment:** Arbitration award may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### X.11 No Governance Rights; Non-Voting

The Participation carries **no governance, voting, consent, or control rights** whatsoever, including without limitation:
- No board observer rights
- No consent rights over corporate actions
- No preemptive rights or rights of first refusal
- No information rights beyond Section X.6
- No right to participate in future equity issuances

### X.12 Entire Agreement; Amendment

This Section X constitutes the entire agreement between Buyer and Seller regarding economic participation and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings. This Section X may be amended only by written agreement signed by both parties.

## Alternative Structures (Reference Only)

### Option 1: Percentage Range Guidance

| Acquisition Price | Recommended Participation % |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| $8M - $15M        | 0.30% - 0.35%              |
| $15M - $25M       | 0.20% - 0.30%              |
| $25M+             | 0.15% - 0.25%              |

### Option 2: Capped Upside (Conservative Alternative)

If Buyer prefers a capped structure:

> "The Participation shall not exceed a maximum payout of **$[10M / 15M / 20M]** in aggregate across all Liquidity Events."

### Option 3: Tiered Payout (Progressive Structure)

For very large outcomes:

> "Payment Amount shall be calculated as follows:
> - First $500M of Total Value Distributed: Full Participation %
> - Next $500M: 50% of Participation %
> - Amounts above $1B: 25% of Participation %"

## Negotiation Guidance

### When to Offer This Structure

**Signals from Buyer that invite equity-equivalent discussion:**
1. "This becomes core to our platform strategy"
2. "We need this embedded everywhere"
3. "This is critical path for agent autonomy"
4. "We're thinking about this as foundational infrastructure"
5. "We want long-term alignment beyond cash"

### How to Introduce It

> "If this becomes the canonical execution authority layer for OpenAI, I'm comfortable keeping the cash component modest and aligning through an equity-equivalent participation structure that doesn't impact your cap table or governance."

### Do NOT Say

- "I want equity" (creates precedent concerns)
- "I need board rights" (non-starter)
- "I want information rights" (governance creep)
- "This should be tied to performance" (reintroduces risk)

### Red Lines (Non-Negotiable)

1. **No forfeiture for non-performance** (defeats the purpose)
2. **No expiration** (must survive until liquidity)
3. **Anti-dilution protection** (maintains economic value)
4. **Binding on successors** (survives M&A)
5. **Cash settlement only** (no forced equity holding)

### Flexible Points (Negotiable)

1. **Percentage** (0.20% - 0.35% range is reasonable)
2. **Cap on upside** (acceptable if significantly high, e.g., $15M-$20M)
3. **Audit scope** (can be more limited)
4. **Dispute resolution venue** (Delaware Chancery Court acceptable alternative)
5. **Withholding treatment** (Buyer preference on who bears cost)

## Integration with Asset Purchase Agreement

### Where This Goes in the APA

- Cross-referenced in Purchase Price calculation section

### Key APA Cross-References

1. **Purchase Price Section:** 
   > "In addition to the Cash Consideration, Seller shall receive the Economic Participation right set forth in Exhibit X."

2. **Closing Deliverables:**
   > "Buyer shall execute and deliver the Economic Participation Agreement in the form of Exhibit X."

3. **Representations & Warranties:**

4. **Survival:**
   > "The obligations under Exhibit X shall survive Closing indefinitely, notwithstanding any other survival periods in this Agreement."

## Counsel Instructions

**For your counsel:**

1. **Section 409A Review:** Have tax counsel confirm 409A compliance or exemption qualification
2. **State Law Review:** Confirm enforceability under Delaware law (or applicable jurisdiction)
3. **Accounting Treatment:** Consider whether this requires reserve/liability on Buyer's balance sheet
4. **Securities Law:** Confirm this does not constitute a "security" requiring registration
5. **Bankruptcy Implications:** Review acceleration clause (X.9(c)) for preference risk

**For buyer's counsel:**

1. This structure is **precedent-safe** (no governance, non-transferable, contractual)
2. This is **cheaper than equity** (no dilution, no board seat, limited information rights)
3. This is **flexible** (can be capped, tiered, or modified without board approvals typical of equity grants)
4. This **aligns incentives** without creating ongoing friction

## Final Notes

- **This is a negotiation starting point**, not a take-it-or-leave-it demand
- **Priority remains closing fast** with $25M cash
- **Only introduce this if Buyer signals expanded strategic importance**
- **Do not lead with this**—let them invite the conversation
- **If they prefer pure cash, accept and close**
