#### Preliminary Conclusion

**Clearance Status:** GREEN LIGHT ✅

The mark "bickford" appears available for use in connection with computer software and SaaS offerings in Classes 9 and 42. No confusingly similar marks were identified that would likely prevent registration or commercial use.

**Recommendation:**
- File intent-to-use application with USPTO (Classes 9 and 42)
- Secure relevant domain names (bickford.ai, bickford.io)
- Monitor USPTO for new applications during transaction period

---

## FILING STRATEGY

### Option 1: No Filing (Common Law Only)

**Pros:**
- No cost
- No prosecution delays
- Sufficient for immediate transaction

**Cons:**
- Limited geographic protection (use-based only)
- Weaker enforcement rights
- Buyer may require registration

**Recommended If:** Buyer plans immediate rebrand or integration into existing product line

---

### Option 2: Intent-to-Use (ITU) Application

**Pros:**
- Establishes priority date
- Low initial cost ($350-$500 per class)
- Can be assigned to buyer post-Closing

**Cons:**
- 6-12 month examination period
- Requires "use in commerce" to complete registration
- Potential office actions requiring response

**Recommended If:** Buyer wants trademark protection; transaction closes within 3-6 months

**Process:**
1. File ITU application (Classes 9 and 42)
2. Await examination (~3-6 months)
3. File Statement of Use after buyer begins commercial use
4. Registration issued (~6-12 months total)

---

### Option 3: Use-Based Application (Immediate)

**Pros:**
- Fastest path to registration (if use can be demonstrated)
- Stronger immediate rights
- No Statement of Use required

**Cons:**
- Requires actual "use in commerce" (sales, services offered)
- May not be available for proof-of-concept stage

**Recommended If:** Bickford has been offered commercially or demonstrable SaaS service exists
