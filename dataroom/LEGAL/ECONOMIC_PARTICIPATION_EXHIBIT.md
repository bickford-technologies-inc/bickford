## EXHIBIT A — Economic Participation Right

### **A. Grant of Participation**

At the Closing, Buyer shall grant Seller an **economic participation right** (the "Participation") equal to **[0.20%–0.35%]** of Buyer's **Fully-Diluted Equity Value**, determined immediately prior to the applicable Liquidity Event.

### **B. Vesting**

The Participation shall **vest in full at Closing**, shall not be subject to forfeiture, repurchase, service requirements, performance milestones, or earn-out conditions, and shall survive termination of this Agreement.

### **C. Nature of Right**

The Participation constitutes a **cash-settled contractual economic right** only. It does **not** represent or confer:

(i) equity securities,  
(ii) voting rights,  
(iii) governance rights,  
(iv) information rights except as expressly provided herein, or  
(v) any ownership interest in Buyer.

### **D. Liquidity Events**

"**Liquidity Event**" means the occurrence of any transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which equity holders of Buyer receive **cash or cash-equivalent consideration**, including without limitation:

1. an initial public offering;
2. a tender offer or secondary liquidity program approved by Buyer;
3. a merger, consolidation, or sale of control;
4. a sale of all or substantially all assets followed by a distribution to equity holders; or
5. any recapitalization or reorganization resulting in a distribution of value to equity holders.

### **E. Payment Mechanics**

Upon consummation of a Liquidity Event, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to:

> **Participation Percentage × Gross Value Distributed to Equity Holders**

Payment shall be made **concurrently with** distributions to equity holders and shall be **net only of customary transaction expenses**.

### **F. Structural Adjustments**

The Participation shall be equitably adjusted to reflect stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations, reclassifications, or similar events to preserve economic equivalence.

### **G. No Expiration**

The Participation shall not expire and shall remain outstanding until satisfied upon a Liquidity Event.

### **H. Calculation Statement**

Within thirty (30) days following a Liquidity Event, Buyer shall deliver a calculation statement reasonably detailing the determination of the payment amount. Seller shall have a single audit right limited to verification of such calculation.

## ONE-PAGE COUNSEL MEMO

### **Why This Structure Avoids Securities Issuance Risk**

**To:** Transaction Counsel  
**From:** Deal Team  
**Re:** Economic Participation Structure — Securities Law Risk Mitigation

---

#### **Summary**

The Participation is intentionally structured as a **cash-settled contractual right**, not an equity issuance, and therefore does **not** constitute the issuance of a "security" under U.S. federal or state securities laws.

---

#### **Key Risk-Avoidance Features**

**1. No Equity Issuance**

The Participation does not involve issuance of stock, options, RSUs, SAFEs, or any instrument convertible into equity.

**2. Cash-Settled Only**

All value is realized exclusively through **cash payment upon Liquidity Events**, eliminating trading, transfer, or market concerns.

**3. No Governance or Voting Rights**

The holder receives no voting, consent, inspection, or board rights—critical to avoiding "investment contract" characterization under the Howey test.

**4. No Expectation of Managerial Profits**

Seller does not rely on Buyer's managerial efforts for profit generation beyond ordinary company growth, aligning with Howey-test exclusions for contractual consideration tied to the enterprise's success.

**5. No Ongoing Relationship or Service Requirement**

Full vesting at Closing removes continued service or performance dependence, eliminating compensatory equity treatment that could trigger securities registration.

**6. No Cap-Table Impact**

The Participation does not appear on the capitalization table and introduces no precedent risk for future financings or equity compensation programs.

---

#### **Precedent Alignment**

Structures of this type are commonly used in:

* **Technology asset purchases** (acqui-hires with cash-settled earn-outs)
* **IP acquisitions** (patent portfolio purchases with milestone payments)
* **Founder-led tuck-ins** where equity issuance is undesirable due to cap table complexity

These transactions consistently avoid securities registration because the payment right is:
- Tied to specific objective events (liquidity)
- Not dependent on holder's ongoing participation
- Cash-settled without equity ownership transfer

---

#### **Conclusion**

This structure materially reduces securities-law exposure while preserving economic alignment. It is conservative, enforceable, and appropriate for private or public company buyers.

**Recommended Action:** Proceed with standard asset purchase documentation. No securities registration or exemption analysis required beyond standard representation that holder is an accredited investor (if applicable under state law).

## VALUATION ANALYSIS TABLE

### **What 0.20%–0.35% Means in Real Outcomes**

| Buyer Valuation at Liquidity Event | 0.20%  | 0.25%   | 0.30%  | 0.35%   |
|------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| **$10B**                           | $20M   | $25M    | $30M   | $35M    |
| **$25B**                           | $50M   | $62.5M  | $75M   | $87.5M  |
| **$50B**                           | $100M  | $125M   | $150M  | $175M   |
| **$75B**                           | $150M  | $187.5M | $225M  | $262.5M |
| **$100B**                          | $200M  | $250M   | $300M  | $350M   |
| **$150B**                          | $300M  | $375M   | $450M  | $525M   |

---

### **Interpretation for Corp Dev**

#### **Conservative Anchor Point**
* **$25M cash today** ≈ **0.25% participation at $10B valuation**
* This means Buyer breaks even on the participation structure only if they reach $10B valuation
* Any valuation below $10B = Buyer pays less than pure cash deal
* Any valuation above $10B = Buyer benefits from reduced upfront cash while still aligning seller

#### **Upside Characteristics**
* Upside participation is capped **only by Buyer's success**, not by seller negotiating leverage
* At $25B valuation (2.5x the break-even), participation = $62.5M at 0.25% (2.5x the cash equivalent)
* At $50B valuation (5x break-even), participation = $125M at 0.25% (5x the cash equivalent)

#### **Risk/Reward Profile**

| Scenario | Buyer Outcome | Seller Outcome |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Valuation never reaches $10B | Buyer saved $25M cash | Seller receives $0 participation |
| Valuation reaches exactly $10B | Break-even vs cash | Seller receives equivalent to cash |
| Valuation exceeds $10B | Participation cost < value created | Seller shares proportionally in upside |

#### **Strategic Implications**
1. **Buyer confidence signal:** Accepting this structure signals Buyer believes in >$10B outcome
2. **Precedent safety:** 0.20%-0.35% range is immaterial at current scale, grows only with success
3. **Alignment without friction:** No governance, no information rights, no ongoing obligations
4. **Tax efficiency:** Cash-settled = no equity dilution, no option accounting complexity

---

## NEGOTIATION GUIDANCE

### **How to Use This in Negotiation**

#### **Sequencing (Critical)**

1. **Lead with Exhibit A** (reads clean, neutral, transaction-standard)
2. **If Legal hesitates**, hand them the **one-page counsel memo** (securities law risk mitigation)
3. **If Finance questions price**, point to the **$10B row** in the valuation table and **stop talking**

#### **The Right Moment to Introduce**

**Do NOT introduce unless Buyer says one of these:**
- "This becomes core to our platform strategy"
- "We're thinking about this as foundational infrastructure"
- "We need this embedded everywhere"
- "This is critical path for agent autonomy"
- "We want long-term alignment beyond cash"

**If Buyer does NOT say any of these:**
- Accept $25M cash
- Close fast
- Do NOT complicate

#### **Exact Introduction Script**

> "If this becomes the canonical execution authority layer across OpenAI's agent infrastructure, I'm comfortable keeping the cash component modest and aligning long-term through a participation structure that doesn't impact your cap table, governance, or require any ongoing relationship."

**Then stop talking.**

#### **Responses to Common Objections**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We don't do equity for acquisitions" | "This isn't equity—it's a cash-settled contractual right with no cap table impact." |
| "Sets a precedent" | "It's structured to avoid precedent—no governance, non-transferable, tied only to liquidity events you already control." |
| "Too complicated" | "It's eight paragraphs. Your counsel will confirm it's standard for asset deals of this type." |
| "What if we never IPO?" | "It covers all liquidity scenarios—M&A, secondary sales, tender offers. Not IPO-dependent." |
| "This delays closing" | "This is a single exhibit. We can close on the timeline you need." |

## APA INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

### **Where This Attaches in the Asset Purchase Agreement**

#### **Option 1 (Preferred): Standalone Exhibit**

**In the main APA, Section 2 (Purchase Price):**

> **2.1 Cash Consideration.** At Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller cash consideration of **$[18,000,000 / 20,000,000 / 22,000,000]** (the "Cash Consideration").

> **2.2 Economic Participation.** In addition to the Cash Consideration, Buyer shall grant Seller the economic participation right set forth in **Exhibit A** (the "Participation Right").

> **2.3 Total Consideration.** The total consideration for the Purchased Assets consists of (i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) the Participation Right.

**In Section 3 (Closing Deliverables):**

> **3.2 Buyer Deliverables.** At Closing, Buyer shall deliver:
> (a) Wire transfer of the Cash Consideration;
> (b) **Executed Economic Participation Agreement in the form of Exhibit A**;
> (c) [Other standard deliverables]

#### **Option 2: Integrated Section**

If Buyer prefers not to have a separate exhibit, integrate directly into the APA as Section 2.3:

> **2.3 Economic Participation Right.**
> [Insert full text of Exhibit A here]

## ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES (Negotiation Fallbacks)

### **Conservative Fallback: 0.15%–0.20% Range**

If Buyer signals the structure is acceptable but percentage feels high:

| Buyer Valuation at Liquidity Event | 0.15% | 0.18% | 0.20% |
|------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **$10B**                           | $15M  | $18M  | $20M  |
| **$25B**                           | $37.5M| $45M  | $50M  |
| **$50B**                           | $75M  | $90M  | $100M |

**Response:**
> "I can go to 0.20% if that makes this easier. At $10B that's equivalent to $20M cash, which is still below our $25M ask."

### **Capped Upside Alternative**

If Buyer wants a ceiling:

> **Maximum Payment.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate payments under this Exhibit A shall not exceed **$[50M / 75M / 100M]** in total across all Liquidity Events.

**Trade:**
- Buyer caps exposure at very large outcomes
- Seller still participates meaningfully up to cap
- Recommended cap: $75M-$100M (allows 3x-4x upside from $25M base)

### **Tiered Structure (Progressive)**

For extremely large outcomes:

> **Tiered Participation.**
> - First $500M of Total Distributions: Full Participation %
> - Next $500M: 50% of Participation %
> - Distributions above $1B: 25% of Participation %

**Effect:**
- Reduces Buyer's cost at mega-outcomes ($100B+)
- Seller still captures meaningful value at all tiers
- Demonstrates reasonableness and alignment

## TIMING & PROCESS

### **When to Finalize This Structure**

| Deal Stage | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **First Diligence Call** | Do NOT mention; focus on product/fit |
| **Second Diligence Call** | Listen for strategic importance signals |
| **Term Sheet Discussion** | Introduce IF signals present; otherwise accept cash |
| **APA Negotiation** | Finalize percentage and mechanics |
| **Legal Review** | Provide counsel memo to accelerate |

### **Expected Legal Review Timeline**

- **Initial review:** 2-4 hours (standard M&A counsel)
- **Securities analysis:** 1-2 hours (if requested)
- **Tax review (409A):** 2-3 hours (tax counsel)
- **Total delay to closing:** 0-3 days (if introduced early in APA drafting)

### **Red Lines (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **No forfeiture for non-performance** (vested at closing)
2. **No expiration date** (survives until liquidity)
3. **Anti-dilution protection** (equitable adjustments required)
4. **Binding on successors** (survives Buyer M&A)
5. **Cash settlement only** (no forced equity holding)

### **Flexible Points (Negotiable)**

1. **Percentage** (0.15%-0.35% all defensible)
2. **Cap on upside** (acceptable if ≥$75M)
3. **Audit scope** (can be more limited than full books access)
4. **Dispute resolution** (arbitration vs. Delaware Chancery Court both fine)
5. **Expense offset** (can accept up to 5% transaction cost offset)

---

## TAX & ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS

### **For Seller (Tax Treatment)**

**Likely Treatment:**
- Taxable as ordinary income upon cash receipt at Liquidity Event
- Not taxed at Closing (no cash or property received)
- Section 409A compliant if structured correctly (deferred compensation rules)

**Planning Opportunities:**
- Consider installment sale treatment if Liquidity Event is staged
- Charitable remainder trust structures available pre-liquidity
- State tax planning if relocating before Liquidity Event

### **For Buyer (Accounting Treatment)**

**Likely Treatment:**
- Contingent consideration liability on balance sheet
- Fair value estimate required at acquisition date
- Revalued each reporting period with changes through P&L

**Why This Is Acceptable:**
- Liability is contingent on Buyer's success (grows only if value grows)
- No cash outflow until Liquidity Event (when Buyer has capital)
- Immaterial at current scale (0.20%-0.35% of future value)

### **Section 409A Compliance Checklist**

✅ **Payment tied to objective event** (Liquidity Event = unambiguous)  
✅ **No acceleration without 409A event** (liquidity events qualify)  
✅ **No elective payout** (automatic upon event)  
✅ **Specified time for payment** (concurrent with distributions)  
✅ **No subsequent deferral elections** (seller cannot change terms)

**Recommended:** Have tax counsel confirm 409A compliance or exemption qualification.
