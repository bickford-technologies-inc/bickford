# Bickford Mobile UI (PWA)

This is a minimal mobile-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) UI for Bickford OPTR TV2, built with React + Vite + vite-plugin-pwa.

## Quick Start

```

- Open http://localhost:5173 on your mobile device or emulator.
- The app is installable as a PWA ("Add to Home Screen").

```

## Extend
