{"type":"knowledge","intent":"Add to Bickford knowledge: podcast excerpt defining qubits and Schrödinger’s cat analogy","summary":"A qubit is described as a quantum bit that exists as a superposition of 0 and 1. The excerpt explains this through Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment and notes that the Schrödinger equation (1930s) is to quantum mechanics what F=ma is to classical mechanics, illustrating how a hypothetical mechanism tied to a poison vial could leave a cat in a counterintuitive alive-or-dead superposed state.","sources":["User-provided transcript excerpt from The AI in Business Podcast: What Executives Need to Know About Quantum Computing and AI (Jan 23, 2026) https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ai-in-business-podcast/id670771965?i=1000746337970&r=486"],"createdAt":"2026-01-23T00:00:00Z"}

The speaker frames room-temperature superconductor design as a flagship quantum simulation problem, noting that such a material would enable lossless electricity transmission and frictionless transport (e.g., maglev trains), and pairs it with drug design as another major application area.","sources":["User-provided podcast excerpt: The AI in Business Podcast: What Executives Need to Know About Quantum Computing and AI (Jan 23, 2026) https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ai-in-business-podcast/id670771965?i=1000746337970&r=1203"],"createdAt":"2026-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
