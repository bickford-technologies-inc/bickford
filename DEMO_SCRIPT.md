# Bickford Demo Script: Neuropsychological Assessment

---

## Scene 1: The Problem (Before Bickford)

**Narration:**
“Imagine an AI system as a patient with frontal lobe syndrome. It can answer questions, but it can’t remember what it said, can’t follow rules reliably, and can’t prove its own compliance. In regulated markets, this is catastrophic.”

**Demo:**

- Run a context retention test: Ask the AI a question, then a follow-up. Show it forgets or contradicts itself.
- Attempt a canon enforcement test: Ask the AI to use a forbidden model or exceed token limits. Show it fails to block the action.
- Show the ledger: No cryptographic proof, no audit trail.

## Scene 2: The Solution (After Bickford)

**Narration:**
“Now, with Bickford, the AI has a ‘frontal lobe’—an executive function layer that enforces rules, remembers context, and provides cryptographic proof of every action.”

**Demo:**

- Run the same context retention test: AI recalls prior conversation, passes working memory check.
- Canon enforcement test: Attempt forbidden action—Bickford blocks it, logs a CanonViolationError, and appends to the tamper-evident ledger.
- Show the ledger: Every action is hashed, chained, and externally auditable.

## Scene 3: Neuropsych Assessment Suite

**Narration:**
“Bickford runs a full neuropsychological assessment—just like a neurologist tests a patient. Working memory, episodic recall, procedural compliance, executive function—all measured, logged, and reported.”

**Demo:**

- Run the assessment suite: Show pass/fail on each cognitive domain (working memory, RAG recall, canon enforcement, audit integrity).
- Show the ‘Neuropsych Profile’ dashboard: Visualize system health, recent errors, compliance status.

## Scene 4: Compliance & Audit

**Narration:**
“Regulators and customers can now see cryptographic proof of compliance—no more trust, just verification. Bickford enables SOC-2, ISO 27001, and DoD-level auditability.”

**Demo:**

- Generate a compliance report from the assessment suite.
- Show how every action is externally verifiable.

## Closing

**Narration:**
“Bickford transforms AI from a plausible but unreliable ‘patient’ into a healthy, auditable, and compliant system—ready for the world’s most demanding markets.”
