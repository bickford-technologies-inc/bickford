# CODEX-INSTRUCTIONS.md

This file is a detailed guide for Bickford Copilot and Codex usage. See .github/copilot-instructions.md for canonical rules.

## Key Bickford Patterns

- Bun-native APIs only
- Canon enforcement = hard fail
- Ledger append on every mutation
- Hash chain integrity always
- Dual-purpose: compliance + intelligence
- TypeScript strict mode
- Workspace imports only
- bun:test for all tests
