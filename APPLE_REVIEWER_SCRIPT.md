Hello Apple App Review Team,

Thank you for reviewing Bickford.

Bickford is a decision continuity and execution intelligence application.
It allows users to record, review, and analyze decisions they explicitly initiate.

Important clarifications:

- Bickford performs no background automation.
- All actions are user-initiated.
- No tracking or analytics SDKs are used.
- No hidden or dynamic code execution is performed.
- Activity is visible and auditable in the UI.

Bickford does not control external systems.
It provides decision continuity, auditability, and analytics only.

If you have any questions, we are happy to provide clarification.

Thank you for your time and review.
