Subject: Intro request: Strategic tech acquisition

[CONTACT],

I'm reaching out about a strategic technology acquisition opportunity 
for large model providers. The technology addresses a critical gap in 
session completion runtime - specifically, execution authority for 
long-running AI agents.

Key details:
• $25M cash + equity participation (IPO-conditional)
• Legal structure validated by external counsel
• Technology proven via shadow mode demos
• Defensive play: prevents cloud providers from owning this layer

Would you be willing to make a warm intro to [TARGET]'s corp dev team? 
I have a 1-pager and demo ready to share.

Thanks for considering,
[YOUR NAME]
```
