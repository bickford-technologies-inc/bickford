The Compounding Intelligence Law

Let:
Dt = decisions required at time t
Mt = decisions encoded in rules
Bt = human burden

Bt = |Dt - Mt|

Promotion rule:
Mt+1 = Mt + ΔM
ΔM = { d ∈ Dt | d proven + enforced }

As t → ∞:
Bt → 0

Bickford does not fine-tune.
Bickford does not guess.
Bickford learns structurally.

Rules are immutable.
Execution patterns become permanent law.
Humans never re-explain known intent.

Traditional AI:
Learns fast, forgets faster.

Bickford:
Learns once, enforces forever.
