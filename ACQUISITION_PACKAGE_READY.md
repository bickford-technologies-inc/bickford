## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### **Demo Strategy**
1. **Lead with the gap**: Show that Constitutional AI is aspirational, not mechanical
2. **Show, don't tell**: Live demo beats slides every time
3. **Follow the money**: Always tie back to $450M-750M TAM
4. **Prove it works**: Real metrics, real customers, real compliance artifacts

### **Pitch Strategy**
1. **Frame as infrastructure**: "Missing piece to make Constitutional AI defensible"
2. **Create urgency**: DoD Q2 2026 deadline is real and approaching
3. **Show competitive threat**: OpenAI/Google catching up (eventually)
4. **De-risk decision**: Production-ready, proven, integrated in <1 week

### **Negotiation Strategy**
1. **Anchor high**: $100M-150M starting point
2. **Justify with 3-year value**: $857M-1.847B
3. **Highlight alternatives**: Build internally = 18-24 months, miss DoD wave
4. **Emphasize exclusivity**: 30-day validation period locks out competitors
